The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created. This type of database can be less complex to work with since no partitioning scheme needs to be defined, but you can create only global secondary indexes.\n\nIBM Cloudant strongly encourages you to use a partitioned database for best long-term database performance where the data model allows for logical partitioning of documents.\n\nThe partitioning type of a database is set at database creation time. When you create a database, use the partitioned query string parameter to set whether the database is partitioned.

The natural network and system characteristics of the network might mean that changes made to a document stored in one location can't instantly update or replicate to other parts of the database.\n\nIn other words, independent updates can be made to different copies of documents. The effect of these updates might be to introduce disagreement or \"conflicts\" as to what is the correct, definitive content for the document.\n\nIBM® Cloudant® for IBM Cloud® tries to help you avoid conflicts by warning you of potential problems. It warns you by returning a [409 response](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantlist-of-http-codes) to a problematic update request. However, a 409 response might not be received if the database update is requested on a system that isn't currently connected to the network. For example, the database might be on a mobile device that is temporarily disconnected from the Internet, which makes it impossible to check whether other potentially conflicting updates were made.\n\nIf you request a document that is in a conflict situation, IBM Cloudant returns the document as expected. However, an internal algorithm considers a number of factors before it determines which document version to return. You must not assume that the returned document is the most recent version.\n\nFor example, if you don't check for conflicts, or fail to address them, your IBM Cloudant database can exhibit the following behaviors:\n\n\n\n* Increasing inconsistencies in document content because more conflicting documents occur.\n* Increasing database size because all conflicting documents must be kept until the conflict is resolved.\n* Decreasing performance because IBM Cloudant must work harder in response to each request as it tries to identify the \"best possible\" version of a conflicted document.\n\n\n\nThe following suggested practices might help you decide when to check for, and resolve, conflicts:\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Now the model is immutable. To add an order, I create a new order document in the database, which cannot generate conflicts.\n\nTo be able to retrieve all orders for a specific customer, we can employ a view, which we cover later.\n\nAvoid constructs that rely on updates to parts of existing documents, where possible. Bad data models are often hard to change after you’re in production.\n\nThe previous pattern can be solved efficiently by using partitioned databases, which are covered in greater detailed later.\n\nFor more information, see the following documentation:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant guide to [data modeling](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-five-tips-for-modeling-your-data-to-scale-faq)\n* [Database partitions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Keep documents small \n\nIBM Cloudant imposes a max doc size of 1 MB. This limit does not mean that a close-to-1-MB document size is a good idea. On the contrary, if you find you are creating documents that exceed single-digit KB, you probably need to revisit your model. Several things in IBM Cloudant become less performant as documents grow. JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small. It’s worth stressing that models that rely on updates have a maximum volume limit of 1 MB, the cut-off for document size. This size isn’t what you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n Avoid using attachments \n\nIBM Cloudant has support for storing attachments alongside documents, a long-standing feature it inherits from CouchDB. If you use IBM Cloudant as a backend for a web application, you can also store small icons and other static assets such as CSS and JavaScript files with the data.\n\nYou must consider a few things before you use attachments in IBM Cloudant today, especially if you’re looking at larger assets such as images and videos:\n\n\n\n1."}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06968-18330-20453", "source": "discovery-data", "score": 13.357092, "text": "\nPlus (includes Trial) 10 MB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Field limits \n\nWhen a document is added to a collection, content from the document is evaluated and added to the appropriate fields in an internal index.\n\nFor structured data, such as uploaded CSV or JSON files, or data from crawled databases, each column or object is stored as a root-level field. For example, if you add a CSV file to collection, each column in the CSV file is stored as a separate field in the index.\n\nA maximum of 1,000 fields can be added to the index.\n\nYou cannot assign the data type, such as Date or String, of a field. The data type is detected automatically and assigned to the field during document ingestion. The assignment is based on the data type that is detected from the first document that is indexed. Ingestion errors can occur in subsequent documents if a different data type is detected for the value in the same field. Therefore, if your documents have a mix of data types in a single field, first ingest the document that has a value with the most flexible data type, such as String, in the field.\n\nWhen you crawl a website or upload an HTML file, the HTML content is added to the collection and indexed in an html field.\n\nThe following table shows the maximum size limit for fields per document.\n\n\n\nMaximum field sizes\n\n Field type Maximum allowed size per document \n\n html field 5 MB \n Sum of all other fields 1 MB \n\n\n\nIf the maximum size of the fields in the document exceeds the allowed limits, they are treated as follows:\n\n\n\n* For a document with an oversized html field, all of the fields in the document are indexed except the html field.\n\nFor IBM Cloud Pak for Data version 4.0 and earlier, the entire document is not indexed.\n* For a document with oversized non-HTML fields, the document is not indexed.\n\n\n\nIf you are uploading a Microsoft Excel file and a message is displayed that indicates that the non-HTML field size limit is exceeded, consider converting the XLS file into a CSV file.

By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script.

Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it."}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "source": "watson-assistant", "score": 14.082313, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms.

Regardless of the process used to acquire the identity, after the bulk import has been completed you will need to click on each imported node.

After clicking on this box, you will be able to associate the relevant identity by selecting it from your Wallet. Note that this process is distinctly different than the process for importing individual nodes, where you will be asked to associate an identity as part of the import process.\n\nYou will also need to associate an admin identity for the CA.

When actions requiring the permission level of an admin are performed against the component, the signing certificate of the entity attempting the action is checked against the signing certificate inside the node.

Authenticated external users can communicate with the master over the public network, such as to run kubectl commands.

The load balancer is multizonal and routes requests for your app through the private NodePorts that are automatically opened on your worker nodes.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-39512-41555", "source": "Cloudant", "score": 17.044382, "text": "\nThe Query is a standard JavaScript object, which is passed to the db.find function which it POSTs to the _find endpoint on your behalf.\n\nNow, time for a practical exercise.

The IBM Cloudant Query documentation is at the on-screen URL if you need it.\n\nPause the presentation here if you don't want to know the answer...\n\nSee one solution:\n\nI use the $and operator to combine two clauses on the date attribute. One clause to locate documents whose date >= 1900, the other to find documents whose date is < the year 2000. Both clauses have to be true to select a document. As we need only the title of the matching books, we can supply a fields attribute instead of being returned the entire document.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Query is a query language that is inspired by MongoDB where the syntax is expressed in JSON form.\n\nQueries select subsets of documents from the database by using clauses that operate on data inside the document - not just the document's _id.\n\nQueries are sent to the database's _find endpoint, either programmatically, by using curl, or by using the Dashboard.\n\nThe query's selector decides which cut of data is required,\n\nThat's the end of this part.

For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query.

Conversations can have multiple requests within a single conversation, but a single request doesn't span more than 1 conversation.\n\nRequest is a root-level utterance, such as an initial question or request, that signals the start of a specific flow. A user can initiate multiple requests. Requests are meant to represent the core concepts or topics your users are asking about. A request can have multiple steps within it, for example I want to order a pizza is a request. Delivery/takeout, Small/Medium/Large, Cheese/Pepperoni/Mushrooms/Peppers are all steps within the request of ordering a pizza.\n\n\n\n\n\n Completion and recognition \n\nThe completion and recognition charts provide information about the actions in your assistant.\n\n![Completion and recognition](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/analytics-completion-recognition-2.png)\n\n\n\n Completion \n\nCompletion is the measurement of how often users are able to successfully get through all steps of an action.\n\nYour assistant measures when someone reaches the final step of an action.

For users who are not authenticated, this is typically a generated ID, and it cannot be changed after the JWT is created. However, you can use a private variable to authenticate a user later in the session.\n\nWith web chat security enabled, the user ID associated with each message is based on the sub claim in the JWT payload. This value must be set at the beginning of the session, when the JWT is created, and cannot be changed during the life of the session. For unauthenticated (anonymous) users, you would typically use a generated ID, saved to a cookie, to ensure that each unique customer is counted only once for billing purposes.\n\nHowever, you might want your customers to be able to authenticate in the middle of a session (for example, to complete an action that updates the user's account information). Because the generated user ID in the sub claim cannot be changed, you need another way to authenticate the user securely. You can do this by storing the customer's actual authenticated user ID as a private variable in the user payload of the JWT. (You could store the user ID in an ordinary context variable, but this would not be secure, because such variables can be modified.)\n\nFor a complete, working version of the example described in this tutorial, see [Enabling security for Watson Assistant web chat](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/tree/master/integrations/webchat/examples/web-chat-security).\n\nThis example in this tutorial, which is based on an Express server for Node.js, shows how to start a session with an anonymous user ID and then authenticate the user during the session.\n\n\n\n1.

If the user chooses to sign in, you can allow them to still access their anonymous attributes by attaching their anonymous profile to their user identity with App ID.\n\n\n\n Understanding progressive authentication \n\nWhen a user chooses not to sign in immediately, they are considered an anonymous user. For example, say you're an online retailer and you want to allow users to add objects to their shopping cart without signing in. However, you ask them to sign in to complete their purchase. If a user chooses to sign in, you can allow them to access the same objects that were in their shopping carts before they signed in.\n\nYou can use App ID to gather information about anonymous users into an anonymous user profile, which you can use to help personalize their experience of your application. If the user chooses to signs in, you can attach the user attributes that are part of the anonymous profile to their user identity that is stored in App ID. Anonymous profiles are temporarily valid. While you develop your app, you can [configure the lifetime](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-managing-idpidp-token-lifetime) of anonymous tokens.\n\nWhen a user signs in, they become an identified user. If an existing identified user profile does not exist, you can create a new identified user profile. After a user is identified, App ID issues new access and identity tokens and their anonymous token becomes invalid. However, an identified user can still access the attributes of their anonymous profile because they are accessible with the new access and identity tokens.\n\nYou can attach the attributes of only one anonymous profile to the user's identity that is stored in App ID. For example, say that a user browses your application anonymously in two separate browser tabs. The user adds a t-shirt to the shopping cart on the first tab and a pair of shorts to the cart on the second tab.

This might seem surprising, but a response with a low confidence score can indicate the best match that the service could find for the given audio, even though the response is unlikely to match the grammar. If the response does not match the grammar, the confidence value of the results is typically low enough to indicate the unlikelihood that the grammar can generate the response.\n\nAlways consider the confidence score when evaluating whether a response satisfies a grammar. If you don't know what threshold to set for rejection of a result based on its confidence, use an initial value of 0.5. If you experience unexpectedly large rejection rates of correct results, decrease the confidence threshold; for instance, 0.1 can be a good option for some applications. If you experience large numbers of incorrect recognition results, increase the confidence threshold for your application.\n\nIn many cases, an empty result or a result with a very low confidence score is a valid response. It can indicate that the user did not understand the question or the available options. You can always recognize the user's audio response without the grammar, but you then run the risk of getting a result that is not valid for the grammar. Grammars provide more reliable results than n-grams, which always return a result for anything other than complete silence.\n\nKnowing that the result must be one of the valid phrases defined by a grammar is a powerful feature that can simplify an application's response handling. Generally speaking, the service can return results with high confidence only for utterances that are generated by a grammar.

Density can be impacted when a mention that is significant in the domain literature occurs often, but is annotated as different types across the document set.\n\nLow precision is often an indication that you need to improve annotation consistency. To do so, review the annotation guidelines, better train the human annotators, and ensure that human annotators are working in concert and not in isolation from one another.\n\nCheck the inter-annotator agreement score. This score, which measures the degree of agreement between different annotators' output on the same document, is a valuable number. Not only does this score tell you the quality of the ground truth documents that will be used to train the machine learning model, but it also indicates the upper bound of machine learning model performance. A model that is trained on these documents is unlikely to outperform the best agreement that humans can reach. For example, if performance persists at 75 and does not go higher, take a look at the inter-annotator agreement results. If the inter-annotator agreement score is 80, take actions to better train the human annotators and ensure that conflicts are correctly resolved (according to the annotation guidelines) during adjudication. If humans can't agree on how something should be labeled, then it's unlikely that a machine learning model will apply the correct labels.\n* Enhance human annotator guidelines\n\nClear and comprehensive annotator guidelines are a crucial part of a harmonious and successful annotation development effort. Human annotators have a tough job to do. There can be nuances in assigning entity and relation types that are hard to anticipate until you start to work with the domain documents. The guidelines can provide a sanity check to human annotators as they evaluate documents. The guidelines should be a living and changing document, especially at the beginning of the annotation process.

If you configure the project to contain answers in an answer field, you must update the search configuration in Watson Assistant to get the body of the response from the custom answer field.\n* A pretrained SDU model is applied to Document Retrieval for Contracts projects automatically. The pretrained SDU model knows how to recognize terms and concepts that are significant to contracts. As a result, you cannot apply a user-trained SDU model to this project type, but you also don't need to.\n* The SDU tool is rarely used with Content Mining projects.\n\n\n\nYou can use the SDU tool to annotate the following file types only:\n\n\n\n* Image files (PNG, TIFF, JPG)\n* Microsoft PowerPoint\n* Microsoft Word\n* PDF\n\n\n\nFor a complete list of file types that Discovery supports, see [Supported file types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-collectionssupportedfiletypes).\n\nThe Smart Document Understanding tool uses optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from images in the files that it analyzes. Images must meet the minimum quality requirements that are supported by OCR.

The annotation of mentions is required and must occur before you annotate relation types and mentions as coreferences.\n\nThe human annotator can optionally use the concordance tool to ensure that the same text is annotated with the same entity type throughout a document and across annotation sets.\n* Relation mode\n\nIn this mode, the human annotator connects mentions by associating a relation type, as defined in the type system. For example, the mention John Smith might be connected to the mention IBM by the relation type employedBy. The annotation of relation types is optional and can occur before or after you annotate mentions as coreferences.\n* Coreference mode\n\nIn this mode, the human annotator identifies mentions that mean the same thing, thus helping to ensure consistency in the annotations when words are not identical."}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "Yes, there are indeed several types of pre-annotators available.

Check out [Account cancelation and data deletion](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-security-and-complianceaccount-cancelation) for more information.\n\nIn the event that a key is no longer needed or should be removed, Key Protect allows you to delete and ultimately purge keys, an action that shreds the key material and makes any of the data encrypted with it inaccessible.\n\nDeleting a key moves it into a Destroyed state, a \"soft\" deletion in which the key can still be seen and restored for 30 days. After 90 days, the key will be automatically purged, or \"hard deleted\", and its associated data will be permanently shredded and removed from the Key Protect service. If it is desirable that a key be purged sooner than 90 days, it is also possible to hard delete a key four hours after it has been moved into the Destroyed state.\n\nAfter a key has been deleted, any data that is encrypted by the key becomes inaccessible, though this can be reversed if the key is restored within the 30-day time frame. After 30 days, key metadata, registrations, and policies are available for up to 90 days, at which point the key becomes eligible to be purged. Note that once a key is no longer restorable and has been purged, its associated data can no longer be accessed.

When you assign access to a namespace, the policy applies to all current and future instances of the namespace in all the clusters that you authorize. For example, say that you want a dev group of users to be able to deploy Kubernetes resources in a test namespace in all your clusters in AP North. If you assign the dev access group the Writer service access role for the Kubernetes namespace test in all clusters in the AP North region within the default resource group, the dev group can access the test namespace in any AP North cluster in the default resource group that currently has or eventually has a test namespace. If you scope a service access role to a namespace, you can't apply the policy to a resource group or assign a platform access role at the same time.\n\nResource group\n: You can organize your account resources in customizable groupings so that you can quickly assign individual or groups of users access to more than one resource at a time. Resource groups can help operators and administrators filter resources to view their current usage, troubleshoot issues, and manage teams.\n: A cluster can be created in only one resource group that you can't change afterward.

Client VPN for VPC supports the following protocols:\n\nUDP is recommended for optimal performance; TCP for reliability.\n\n\n\n* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\n\nThe User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simple, lightweight protocol with minimum overhead. If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires. This timer is needed in case a packet becomes lost or corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Full versus split-tunnel mode \n\nWhen a VPN connection is set up, an encrypted tunnel is created over the internet to the VPN server. The VPN connection appears as a virtual network interface to the computer in addition to the existing LAN interface. You can now use both interfaces simultaneously by sending the private traffic destined to the VPC inside the VPN tunnel and the public traffic (internet traffic) over the other interface (outside the VPN tunnel).

Data Security Broker provides easy and feasible way to provide enhanced data protection for sensitive data in public or private cloud environments. The software includes dynamic management of customer-owned keys and the ability to protect databases at a column-level granularity.\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nData Security Broker delivers an enterprise-level transparent data security platform that secures databases through a \"no code\" model at the field or file level.

The Shield is used to intercept SQL or its NoSQL equivalent generated by the application to access data records in the database by encrypting on writes and decrypting on reads.\n\nThe encryption process manages keys that are generated by a commercially available key management service such as IBM® Key Protect and Hyper Protect Crypto Services.\n\nApplication performance is minimally impacted allowing for enterprise workflows to continue to operate in a secure environment.

After you apply the model to your collection, you can apply an enrichment to the tips field only. Later, you can limit the search to return content from only the tips field.\n\nOr maybe you have extra large documents that contain subsections.

You can use this history to improve how your assistants understand and respond to user requests.\n\nTo open a list of individual messages between customers and the assistant that uses this dialog skill, select User conversations in the navigation bar.\n\nWhen you open the User conversations page, the default view lists inputs that were submitted to the assistant for the last day, with the newest results first. The top intent (#intent) and any recognized entity (@entity) values used in a message, and the message text are available. For intents that are not recognized, the value shown is Irrelevant.

The web chat is hosted on your site and can inherit any vulnerabilities that your site has. Only serve content over HTTPS, use a Content Security Policy (CSP), and implement other basic web security precautions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Billing \n\nWatson Assistant charges based on the number of unique monthly active users (MAU).\n\nBy default, the web chat creates a unique, anonymous ID the first time a new user starts a session. This identifier is stored in a first-party cookie, which remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site and chats with your assistant again while this cookie is still active, the web chat integration recognizes the user and uses the same user ID. This means that you are charged only once per month for the same anonymous user.\n\nOn Apple devices, the Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature automatically deletes any client-side cookie after 7 days. This means that if an anonymous customer accesses your website and then visits again two weeks later, the two visits are treated as two different MAUs.

For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global)."}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02839-7-2335", "source": "assistant-data", "score": 13.608723, "text": "\nAdding support for global audiences \n\nYour customers come from all around the globe. You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point.

You can create backup snapshots as frequently as 1 hour. However, the backup service does not provide continual backup with automatic failover, and restoring a volume from a backup or snapshot is a manual operation that takes time. If you require a higher level of service for automatic disaster recovery, see IBM's [Cloud disaster recovery solutions](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/disaster-recovery).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is restoring a volume from a snapshot? \n\nRestoring from a snapshot creates a new, fully provisioned boot or data volume. You can restore storage volumes during instance creation, instance modification, or when you provision a new stand-alone volume. For data volumes, you can also use the volumes API to create a data volume from a snapshot. For more information, see [Restoring a volume from a snapshot](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-restore).\n\nFor best performance, you can enable snapshots for fast restore. By using the fast restore feature, you can create a volume from a snapshot that is fully provisioned when the volume is created. For more information, see [Snapshots fast restore](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-aboutsnapshots_vpc_fast_restore).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I add tags to a volume? \n\nYes, you can add user tags and access management tags to your volumes. User tags are used by the backup service to automatically create backup snapshots of the volume. Access management tags help organize access to your Block Storage for VPC volumes. For more information, see [Tags for Block Storage for VPC volumes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-about&interface=uistorage-about-tags).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Performance questions", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_14984-4-2041", "source": "vpc", "score": 21.165892, "text": "\n* UI\n* CLI\n* API\n* Terraform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Restoring a volume from a backup snapshot \n\nRestoring from a backup snapshot creates a fully provisioned boot or data volume that you can use to boot an instance or attach as auxiliary storage. You can restore volumes during instance creation or when you want to create stand-alone boot or data volumes to be used later. You can restore a data volume to add more storage to an existing instance. You can use backup snapshots to restore volumes in a different region for business continuity purposes or geographic expansion. You can restore volumes from backup snapshots in the UI, from the CLI, with the API, or Terraform.\n\n\n\n About restoring a volume from a backup snapshot \n\nWhen you restore a volume from a backup, the service creates another volume. The restored volume inherits the same [profile](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles), capacity, data, and metadata as the original volume. However, you can choose a different profile and capacity if you prefer. If the source volume used [customer-managed encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-aboutvpc-customer-managed-encryption), the new volume inherits that encryption.\n\nRestoring a volume from a backup snapshot creates a boot or data volume, depending on whether the snapshot is bootable or nonbootable.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key. Due to this, you can store the wDEK with alongside the associated encrypted data.\n\n\n\nKey Protect uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (AES GCM) to wrap and unwrap DEKs.

It is then sent over the network as crypto text, and then decrypted by the recipient. The encrypted text contains all the original data, and can be decrypted using a private key. However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash.

In scenarios where the customer would like to retain a backup for longer than the standard duration outlined, the IBM SRE team will perform a database backup and save it to the COS bucket. It will then be the responsibility of the customer to download and maintain these backups.

Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router. Setting up routes is not necessary.

Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency.

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture.

Unlike IAM policies, context-based restrictions don't assign access. Context-based restrictions check that an access request comes from an allowed context that you configure. Since both IAM access and context-based restrictions enforce access, context-based restrictions offer protection even in the face of compromised or mismanaged credentials.

To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture.

Within that region, the VPC can span multiple zones.\n\nSubnets in your VPC can connect to the public internet through an optional public gateway. You can assign floating IP addresses to any virtual server instance to enable it to be reachable from the internet, independent of whether its subnet is attached to a public gateway.\n\nSubnets within the VPC offer private connectivity; they can talk to each other over a private link through the implicit router.

Each region contains multiple zones, which represent independent fault domains. A VPC can span multiple zones within its assigned region.\n\n\n\n\n\n Zones \n\nA zone is an abstraction that refers to the physical data center that hosts the compute, network, and storage resources, plus the related cooling and power, which provides services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other to create no shared single point of failure, improved fault tolerance, and reduced latency.

You must access a node that uses this response type from a test deployment to see how your users will experience it.\n* Image: Embeds an image into the response. The source image file must be hosted somewhere and have a URL that you can use to reference it. It cannot be a file that is stored in a directory that is not publicly accessible.\n* Option: Adds a list of one or more options. When a user clicks one of the options, an associated user input value is sent to your assistant. How options are rendered can differ depending on where you deploy the dialog. For example, in one integration channel the options might be displayed as clickable buttons, but in another they might be displayed as a dropdown list.\n* Pause: Forces the application to wait for a specified number of milliseconds before continuing with processing. You can choose to show an indicator that the dialog is working on typing a response. Use this response type if you need to perform an action that might take some time. For example, a parent node makes a Cloud Function call and displays the result in a child node. You could use this response type as the response for the parent node to give the programmatic call time to complete, and then jump to the child node to show the result. This response type does not render in the Try it out pane."}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03185-6701-8694", "source": "assistant", "score": 15.754622, "text": "\n[A sample dialog tree with example content](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/dialog-depiction-full.png)\n\nThe dialog tree in this diagram contains two root dialog nodes. A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview)."}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02952-3289-5462", "source": "assistant-data", "score": 15.711144, "text": "\nAdd meaningful names to the dialog nodes in your dialog.\n\nWhen a conversation is transferred to an agent, the name of the most-recently processed dialog node is sent with it.

The metric primarily uses the Connect to human agent response type as an indicator. If a user conversation log includes a call to a Connect to human agent response type, then the conversation is considered to be not contained.\n\nHowever, not all human interventions are transacted by using a Connect to human agent response type.

It uses machine learning models that are custom-built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search integration with IBM Watson® Discovery to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how IBM Watson® Assistant delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\nZoom\n\n![Flow diagram of the service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/arch-detail.png)\n\nHow it works\n\nCustomers interact with the assistant through one or more of these channels:"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-7-1700", "source": "watson-assistant", "score": 13.205946, "text": "\nHow the web chat works \n\nThe web chat provides an easy-to-use chatbot interface that you can add to your website without writing any code.\n\nAfter you add the web chat script to your website, your customers will see a launcher icon that they can click to open the chat window and start a conversation with the assistant.

Your chatbot, which is also known as an assistant, connects to the customer engagement resources you already use to deliver an engaging, unified problem-solving experience to your customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Create AI-driven conversational flows Your assistant leverages industry-leading AI capabilities to understand questions that your customers ask in natural language. It uses machine learning models that are custom built from your data to deliver accurate answers in real time. \n Embed existing help content You already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter expertise to work. Add a search skill to give your assistant access to corporate data collections that it can mine for answers. \n Connect to your customer service teams If customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a personal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service desk provider. \n Bring the assistant to your customers, where they are Configure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant on popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom, or WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call center team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its human teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant the go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your company website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the APIs to build your own custom app. \n Track customer engagement and satisfaction Use built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and your assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nThis diagram illustrates how the product delivers an exceptional, omnichannel customer experience:\n\n!"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07080-6045-7467", "source": "discovery-data", "score": 28.852352, "text": "\n[checkbox](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/f16b1f78a92498247223b337bd9303c2758b9ba8/discovery-data/images/checkbox.png) Deploy your solution.

The uplift charge is a percentage (%) of the hourly rate (r), and is added to the hourly rate of the worker node. The total hourly rate cost for a worker node can be calculated as r + (r × %). In the [Red Hat OpenShift cluster creation console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/create?platformType=openshift), this uplift is reflected in the pricing calculator as you configure your cluster details. The following table describes the pricing uplift by region.\n: For a table that describes the pricing uplift by region, see [Regional pricing for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/provision/vs).\n\nSustained usage discounts\n: For virtual server instances that are billed at an hourly rate, discounted prices depend on how long the instance runs during the billing month.

A repository that retains immutable backup files for compliance with SEC 17a-4(f) must be configured as a stand-alone backup repository as a Veeam Scale-Out backup Repository is not compliant with this rule.\n* It is recommended that the name and description attributes for the repository include the word “immutable\" when the Linux hardened repository feature is enabled.\n* To protect against the possibility of premature deletion of backup files that can result from accelerating the system time clock, Linux OS must be configured to synchronize with a secure time source. For example, with a network time protocol (NTP) clock.\n* Ensure separation of duties by assigning management of Linux hardened repositories to a team other than backup administrators.\n* Veeam recommends XFS for performance and space efficiency reasons (block cloning support). Due to the requirement for periodic full backups, means that due to fast cloning, synthetic full backups take no physical disk space, except for metadata.\n* Only backup job configurations with forward incremental with synthetic or active full are supported. Forward incremental with synthetic full is the default backup job setting.\n* For backup copy jobs, GFS must be enabled.\n* Encryption of backup files is available as follows:\n\n\n\n* When configured in a backup job, Veeam Backup and Replication can use 256-bit AES block cypher encryption.\n* For data in transit, a global network traffic rule can be configured to enable all traffic to be encrypted through 256-bit AES encryption.

Objects themselves have their own metadata in the form of user-defined tags, legal holds, or archive status. Within a bucket, the hierarchy of objects is effectively \"flat\", although it is possible to add prefixes to object names to provide some organization and to provide flexibility in listing and other operations.\n\nIBM Cloud Object Storage is strongly consistent for all data operations, and eventually consistent for bucket configuration operations. This means that when an object is uploaded, the server responds with a 200 OK after the object is successfully written, and the object is immediately available for listing and reading. All data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage is encrypted, erasure-coded, and dispersed across three locations (with the distance between locations ranging from within a single data center, across a Multi-Zone Region or MZR, or even across multiple MZRs). This geographic range of dispersal contributes to a bucket's resiliency.\n\nAll requests and responses are made over HTTPS and all requests support the use of hash-based integrity checks using a Content-MD5 header. If the provided MD5 hash does not match the checksum computed by the storage service, the object is discarded and an error is returned. All GET and HEAD requests made to objects return an Etag value with the MD5 hash of the object to ensure integrity on the client side.\n\nDevelopers use APIs to interact with their object storage."}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05166-15912-16684", "source": "cloud-object-storage", "score": 13.547807, "text": "\nThis allows for lower latency when accessing storage from compute resources co-located within the same data center, or for data requiring a specific geographic location.

Data Integrity and Long-term Data Retention: Immutable Object Storage preserves electronic records and maintains data integrity. It ensures that data is stored in a WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many), no-erasable and non-rewritable manner, which can be beneficial for industries like Financial, Healthcare, and Media content archives where data integrity is crucial. \n 2. Compliance: Immutable Object Storage can help organizations comply with certain regulations like SEC Rule 17a-4(f), FINRA Rule 4511(c), and CFTC Rule 1.31(c)-(d) that govern electronic records storage and retention. When using immutable Object Storage, it is the client's responsibility to check for and ensure whether any of the feature capabilities that are discussed can be used to satisfy and comply with the key rules around electronic records storage and retention governed by the above-mentioned regulations.\nDisadvantages:  \n1. Limited Availability: Immutable Object Storage is available in certain regions only. Users outside these regions may not be able to use this feature. \n2. Pricing: It requires a Standard pricing plan, which could be a disadvantage for users looking for more affordable options.  \n3. No High-speed Transfer: It isn't possible to use Aspera high-speed transfer with buckets with a retention policy. This could potentially slow down the data transfer process.  \n4. Irreversible: Once permanent retention is enabled, it can't be reversed. Objects uploaded that use a permanent retention period cannot be deleted. This means users need to be sure about their need to permanently store objects. \n5. Legal Holds: The retention policy is enforced until the end of a retention period and the removal of any legal holds. This could potentially cause issues if there are legal disputes or investigations. Please note that the actual advantages and disadvantages may vary depending on the specific use case and requirements.\nTo assist clients in making informed decisions, IBM engaged Cohasset Associates Inc. to conduct an independent assessment of IBM’s Immutable Object Storage.\n\n", "metadata": {"author_type": "model", "author_id": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01", "created_at": 1723130825}}, {"speaker": "user", "text": "Are Cohasset Associates, Inc., a legal or IT management consulting firm?", "metadata": {"author_type": "human", "author_id": "900c5521-fad3-4838-ac17-7c3ce7154250", "created_at": 1723132713}}, {"speaker": "agent", "text": "Cohasset Associates, Inc. is an IT management consulting firm engaged by IBM to conduct an independent assessment of IBM’s Immutable Object Storage.

Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "source": "cis", "score": 14.464249, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "source": "cis", "score": 11.05156, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

However, the default security stance can interfere with many API calls. It is recommended that you take a few actions to prevent interference with your API traffic after proxying is active.\n\n\n\n* Turn security features off selectively, using the Page Rules features.\n\n\n\n* Create a Page Rule with the URL pattern of your API, such as api.example.com\n* Add the following rule behaviors:\n\n\n\n* Select Security Level to Essentially off\n* Select TLS to Off\n* Select Browser Integrity Check to Off\n\n\n\n* Select Provision Resource\n\n\n\n* Alternatively, you can turn off Web Application Firewall globally from the Security page.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does the Browser Integrity Check do? \n\nThe browser integrity check looks for HTTP headers that are commonly abused by spammers. It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a non-standard user agent (this tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 4: Configure your security settings as strictly as possible \n\nCIS provides some options for encrypting your traffic. As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers. For your termination with CIS, you can upload a custom certificate from your account, you can use a wildcard certificate provisioned for you by CIS, or both.\n\n\n\n Upload a custom certificate \n\nYou can upload your public and private key when you create an Enterprise domain. If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default. Manual verification could be required for setting up these certificates, and your support team can help you perform these additional steps."}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-1672-3877", "source": "cis", "score": 13.058725, "text": "\nThe tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

Open the Assets > Dictionaries page and download any dictionaries that you want to re-use in the restored model.\n2. Click Machine Learning Model > Versions and click Promote for the version that you want to restore. The version that you promote becomes the current version, and the version number changes to 2.0.

But, generally, you want the type system to be as close to final as possible before you begin large-scale annotation tasks. If you change the type system after human annotators began their work, they must revisit the documents that they annotated.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

For users who are not authenticated, this is typically a generated ID, and it cannot be changed after the JWT is created. However, you can use a private variable to authenticate a user later in the session.\n\nWith web chat security enabled, the user ID associated with each message is based on the sub claim in the JWT payload. This value must be set at the beginning of the session, when the JWT is created, and cannot be changed during the life of the session. For unauthenticated (anonymous) users, you would typically use a generated ID, saved to a cookie, to ensure that each unique customer is counted only once for billing purposes.\n\nHowever, you might want your customers to be able to authenticate in the middle of a session (for example, to complete an action that updates the user's account information). Because the generated user ID in the sub claim cannot be changed, you need another way to authenticate the user securely. You can do this by storing the customer's actual authenticated user ID as a private variable in the user payload of the JWT. (You could store the user ID in an ordinary context variable, but this would not be secure, because such variables can be modified.)\n\nFor a complete, working version of the example described in this tutorial, see [Enabling security for Watson Assistant web chat](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/tree/master/integrations/webchat/examples/web-chat-security).\n\nThis example in this tutorial, which is based on an Express server for Node.js, shows how to start a session with an anonymous user ID and then authenticate the user during the session.\n\n\n\n1. Create a function called getOrSetAnonymousID() that generates a unique anonymous user ID for each customer and stores it in a cookie (or, if the cookie already exists, uses the stored user ID).\n\nUse a cookie that lasts for at least 45 days."}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02855-25179-26743", "source": "assistant-data", "score": 13.561723, "text": "\nfunction mockLogin() {\nconst payload = {\n/\n* Even if this is an unauthenticated user, add a userID in the sub claim that can be used\n* for billing purposes.\n* This ID will help us keep track \"unique users\".

From the web chat integration page in Watson Assistant, set the Secure your web chat switch to On.\n2. Add your public key to the Your public key field.\n\nThe public key that you add is used to verify that data which claims to come from your web chat instance is coming from your web chat instance.\n3. To prove that a message is coming from your website, each message that is submitted from your web chat implementation must include the JSON Web Token (JWT) that you created earlier.\n\nAdd the token to the web chat code snippet that you embed in your website page. Specify the token in the identityToken property.\n\nFor example:\n\n<script>\nwindow.watsonAssistantChatOptions = {\nintegrationID: 'YOUR_INTEGRATION_ID',\nregion: 'YOUR_REGION',\nserviceInstanceID: 'YOUR_SERVICE_INSTANCE',\nidentityToken: 'YOUR_JWT',\nonLoad: function(instance) {\ninstance.render();\n}\n};\nsetTimeout(function(){\nconst t=document.createElement('script');"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16387-7-1890", "source": "watson-assistant", "score": 13.399436, "text": "\nEnabling web chat security \n\nTo enable web chat security, you must make changes to your web application server code and the web chat embed script, as well as the web chat integration settings.\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you enable security, you must create an RS256 public/private key pair. You can use a tool such as OpenSSL or PuTTYgen.\n\nFor example, to create the key pair at a command prompt using OpenSSL, you would use the command openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048.\n\nSave the generated key pair in a secure location.\n\nMake sure these keys are accessible only by your server code. Never pass them to a client browser through your website.\n\n\n\n\n\n Generating a JWT \n\nTo use web chat security, you must configure the web chat on your website to send a JSON Web Token (JWT) with each message to the assistant. The JWT is used to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data. Your website will need to be able to generate a new JWT at the beginning of each session, and also whenever an existing JWT expires.\n\nDo not hardcode a JWT in your website code or share JWTs between users.\n\nOn your server, implement a function that generates and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is signed with your private key. You will use this token to verify the origin of messages sent from your website, and optionally to carry additional encrypted data.\n\nMost programming languages offer JWT libraries that you can use to generate a token. To validate signed JWTs, the web chat integration uses the [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) library with the RS256 algorithm.\n\nThe JWT payload must specify the following claims:\n\n\n\n* sub: A unique user ID that identifies the customer who is interacting with the web chat.

They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Vulnerability Advisor generates a security status report that includes suggested fixes and best practices. Vulnerability Advisor is available in two versions: version 3 and version 4.

If security issues are found, instructions are provided to help fix the reported vulnerability.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nYou can use IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center to monitor vulnerabilities that are detected by Vulnerability Advisor.

Your containerized apps are hosted on IBM Cloud infrastructure compute hosts that are called worker nodes. You can choose to provision your compute hosts as [virtual machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm) with shared or dedicated resources, or as [bare metal machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesbm) that can be optimized for GPU and software-defined storage (SDS) usage. Your worker nodes are controlled by a highly available Kubernetes master that is configured, monitored, and managed by IBM. You can use the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service API or CLI to work with your cluster infrastructure resources and the Kubernetes API or CLI to manage your deployments and services.\n\nFor more information about how your cluster resources are set up, see the [Service architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_05998-7-2051", "source": "containers", "score": 19.111305, "text": "\nUnderstanding IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service \n\nLearn more about [IBM Cloud® Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/kubernetes-service), its capabilities, and the options that are available to you to customize the cluster to your needs.\n\nReview frequently asked questions and key technologies that IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service uses.\n\n\n\n What is IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and how does it work? \n\nIBM Cloud Kubernetes Service is a managed offering to create your own Kubernetes cluster of compute hosts to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud.

For more information, see [Adding user identity information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-deploy-web-chatdeploy-web-chat-userid).\n\n\n\n\n\n Handling anonymous users \n\nIf your custom application or assistant interacts with users who are anonymous, you can generate a randomized universally unique ID to represent each anonymous user. For more information about UUIDs, see [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122.html).\n\n\n\n* For web chat, if you do not pass an identifier for the user when the session begins, the web chat creates one for you. It creates a first-party cookie with a generated anonymous ID. The cookie remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site later in the month and chats with your assistant again, the web chat integration recognizes the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Service API versioning"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13712-4613-6343", "source": "text-to-speech", "score": 14.035038, "text": "\nA customer ID that you specify is associated with the instance of the service whose credentials are used with the request; only credentials for that instance of the service can delete data associated with the ID.\n\nUse the X-Watson-Metadata header with the following methods:\n\n\n\n* With HTTP requests:\n\n\n\n* POST /v1/synthesize\n* GET /v1/synthesize\n\n\n\nThe customer ID is associated with data that is sent with the request.\n* With WebSocket requests:\n\n\n\n* /v1/synthesize\n\n\n\nYou specify the customer ID with the x-watson-metadata query parameter to associate the ID with data that is sent with the request.

Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g., employing appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality and integrity protection) may provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to information systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization. While organizations may use interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such agreements are not required by this control. Enforcing access restrictions for remote connections is addressed in AC-3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "To secure the phone connection before the interaction, follow the previous steps I've decribed.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products.

In some cases, these may be small issues that affect the performance characteristics of the call but not cause the call to fail.\n\nFor issues like this that ultimately cause a call to fail, there are two ways Watson Assistant can handle the call.

A SIP 500 can then be used to redirect the call to another zone, or if many SIP 500s are received, to another region. Using a SIP 500 INVITE error is a better way to signal a failure to an upstream SIP trunking provider because it gives the provider a way to reroute the call. Using only the default transfer target to handle call failures is acceptable for low call volume scenarios but can result in large numbers of calls being directed to a customer contact center when bigger call volumes are handled by Watson Assistant. To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation.

This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region. Many SIP trunking providers automatically retry each IP in the FQDN when failures occur.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore.

Additionally, you can enforce rate limits through Plans or through operations within a Plan's APIs that override the Plan's rate limit.\n\nPlans can also specify billing costs for customers who use your Products. For example, you can define three different Plans for a single Product. Each Plan can have a different subscription cost and a different rate limit that targets different customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n Products \n\nPlans and APIs are grouped in Products. Through Products, you can manage the availability and visibility of APIs and Plans. Use the API Designer to create, edit, and stage your Product. Use the API Manager to manage the lifecycle of your Product.\n\nThe following diagram demonstrates how Products, Plans, and APIs relate to one another.

A lifecycle manager can then control the availability and visibility of APIs and Plans through the API Manager. Through the Developer Portal, the customer is then able to subscribe to one of the Plans that is available to them, as determined in the API Manager. If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available."}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02597-4595-6892", "source": "apiconnect", "score": 9.910527, "text": "\nThrough the Developer Portal, the customer is then able to subscribe to one of the Plans that is available to them, as determined in the API Manager.

Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

You can purchase and manage bandwidth metering for classic in two ways, through metering on individual devices, or through collective-metering when you add a device to a bandwidth pool.\n\nAll inbound and outbound bandwidth inside the IBM Cloud Classic infrastructure is unlimited and cost-free for your servers' use. Public egress bandwidth is charged on a tiered basis, with a set allocation for each month of your servers' use.\n\nBandwidth usage is measured as egress traffic on a device's public interfaces.\n\nBandwidth allocations are reserved for all public egress network usage. Devices with individual bandwidth metering and pool-based metering are all measured unless the device is ordered on the private network only.\n\nBandwidth allocation is a threshold where usage below the threshold is free or included, while usage in excess of the threshold is billed as a bandwidth overage. Bandwidth overages are billed individually per server or device, unless they participate in a bandwidth pool.\n\nDevices added to a bandwidth pool contribute both their bandwidth allocation and bandwidth usage to form aggregated totals for the pool.

When you provision certain devices, you can select the amount of bandwidth that you want to allocate to that device. For each device, you pay for a fixed amount of bandwidth allocation during a billing cycle, and receive a notification when the device is at risk of overage for the billing cycle. For more information, see [Adding Bare Metal Server bandwidth](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/bandwidth-services?topic=bandwidth-services-adding-bare-metal-server-bandwidth) and [Adding virtual server instance bandwidth](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/bandwidth-services?topic=bandwidth-services-adding-virtual-server-insance-bandwidth).\n\nWhen the bandwidth usage on a device reaches 85% of its total allocation, the account owner receives notifications.\n\nIBM charges for some firewall bandwidth metering."}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03776-3313-5682", "source": "billing-usage", "score": 10.481321, "text": "\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For example, you might buy a subscription for $12,000 USD a year that comes with a 10% discount. No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model.

With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization consumes. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage for the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations.\n\nThe following are the various charging types:\n\n\n\n* Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge that isn't adjusted.\n* Metered: Metered-usage pricing is based on the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage for containers.\n* Tiered: Some pricing plans are based on a tiered pricing model, so you can get a volume-based discount according to your actual usage.

Starting at the enterprise level, you can navigate within the enterprise structure to see the estimated usage costs within each account or account group. At the account level, enterprise users can view costs for each type of resource or service in the account.\n\nEnterprise administrators can provide granular access to users so that they can view usage only for certain account groups or accounts. For example, say that your enterprise has account groups for each department, and each department has account groups for each team.\n\n\n\n* You give your financial officer access to view the entire enterprise so that they can track and recover costs for each department.\n* You give each department lead access to view usage for everything in their department's account group.\n* You give each team lead access to view only the accounts in their team's account group.\n\n\n\nBecause access in the enterprise is separate from access in each account, enterprise users can't automatically manage resources within the child accounts. Similarly, users in each account can continue to view their past and current usage from the Usage page regardless of whether they have enterprise access.\n\nYou can view usage from the Usage page in the console, from the CLI, or from the Enterprise Usage Reports API. For more information, see [Viewing usage in an enterprise](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-enterprise-usage).\n\n\n\n\n\n Invoicing and payments \n\nUsage in the enterprise is invoiced through the enterprise account. As with all billable accounts, usage is invoiced monthly, and the invoice is due on the billing date for your account. During each billing cycle, a single invoice with the usage costs from all accounts is made available in the enterprise account. The invoice contains costs for all platform and infrastructure usage as a single-line item in your invoice."}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03776-3313-5682", "source": "billing-usage", "score": 10.948888, "text": "\nWhen you have a Subscription account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period.

No matter when you incur usage costs within that year, you get fixed billing for the subscription amount, such as $1,000 a month. This account type is a good fit for enterprise organizations with large cloud workloads that want the predictability of fixed billing for their financial planning.\n\nIn addition to the two billable account types, customers that have a Subscription account can sign up for the Enterprise Savings Plan billing model.

Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. An example of this type of charge is the fixed plans for Bare Metal Servers.\n2. Metered: Metered usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. An example of this type of charge is the Push service, where any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n3. Tiered: Tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block. In the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier. An example of this type of charge is the API Connect service, where one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter.\n4. Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. An example of this type of charge is the Db2 on Cloud service, which has reserved plans.", "metadata": {"author_type": "model", "author_id": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01", "created_at": 1724723736}}, {"speaker": "user", "text": "I want to update my pricing plan and view my usage ", "metadata": {"author_type": "human", "author_id": "e9255f72-ebe6-4594-9710-44e51f04c3fc", "created_at": 1724724209}}, {"speaker": "agent", "text": "To update your pricing plan: First, navigate to the IBM Cloud console, go to the Resource List, and select the service.

Fixed: Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. An example of this type of charge is the fixed plans for Bare Metal Servers.\n2. Metered: Metered usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. An example of this type of charge is the Push service, where any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n3. Tiered: Tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block. In the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier. An example of this type of charge is the API Connect service, where one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter.\n4. Reserved: Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. An example of this type of charge is the Db2 on Cloud service, which has reserved plans.", "metadata": {"author_type": "model", "author_id": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01", "created_at": 1724723736}}, {"speaker": "user", "text": "I want to update my pricing plan and view my usage ", "metadata": {"author_type": "human", "author_id": "e9255f72-ebe6-4594-9710-44e51f04c3fc", "created_at": 1724724209}}, {"speaker": "agent", "text": "To update your pricing plan: First, navigate to the IBM Cloud console, go to the Resource List, and select the service.
