Be aware that some earthquakes are actually foreshocks and a larger earthquake might occur. Minimize your movements to a few steps to a nearby safe place and stay indoors until the shaking has stopped and you are sure exiting is safe.\nIf indoors\n\nDROP to the ground; take COVER by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and HOLD ON on until the shaking stops. If there isn’t a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.\nStay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture.\nStay in bed if you are there when the earthquake strikes. Hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place.\nUse a doorway for shelter only if it is in close proximity to you and if you know it is a strongly supported, loadbearing doorway.\nStay inside until shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave.\nBe aware that the electricity may go out or the sprinkler systems or fire alarms may turn on.\nDO NOT use the elevators.\n\nIf outdoors\n\nStay there.\nMove away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires.\nOnce in the open, stay there until the shaking stops. The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings, at exits, and alongside exterior walls. Many of the 120 fatalities from the 1933 Long Beach earthquake occurred when people ran outside of buildings only to be killed by falling debris from collapsing walls.", "title": "FEMA: What to Do During an Earthquake"}, {"document_id": "e37ec44b3e6d0142-2-2068", "source": "", "score": 7.7413216, "text": "FEMA: What to Do After an Earthquake\nFEMA: What to Do After an Earthquake\n\nContact Us\nSite Map\nFrequently Asked Questions\nEspañol\n\nSearch\n\n Advanced Search\n\nHome\nDisaster Information\nPlan Ahead\nApply for Assistance\nRecover & Rebuild\nAbout Us\n\nDisaster Information\nTypes of Disasters\nEarthquake\n\nBefore an Earthquake\nDuring an Earthquake\nAfter an Earthquake\nEarthquake Terms\n\nWhat to Do After an Earthquake\n\nExpect aftershocks. These secondary shockwaves are usually less violent than the main quake but can be strong enough to do additional damage to weakened structures and can occur in the first hours, days, weeks, or even months after the quake.\n\nListen to a battery-operated radio or television. Listen for the latest emergency information.\n\nUse the telephone only for emergency calls.\n\nOpen cabinets cautiously. Beware of objects that can fall off shelves.\n\nStay away from damaged areas. Stay away unless your assistance has been specifically requested by police, fire, or relief organizations. Return home only when authorities say it is safe.\n\nBe aware of possible tsunamis if you live in coastal areas. These are also known as seismic sea waves (mistakenly called \"tidal waves\"). When local authorities issue a tsunami warning, assume that a series of dangerous waves is on the way. Stay away from the beach.\n\nHelp injured or trapped persons. Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance such as infants, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Give first aid where appropriate. Do not move seriously injured persons unless they are in immediate danger of further injury. Call for help.\n\nClean up spilled medicines, bleaches, gasoline or other flammable liquids immediately.

A few key factors have contributed to the recent increase in large and destructive wildfires, including climate change, poor forest and land management practices, and increased development in fire‑prone areas. \n\nWhile Annual Wildfire Seasons Have Lengthened, Strong Seasonal Pattern Still Exists. Despite recent years having particularly large and destructive wildfires and concerns about wildfires becoming a year‑round phenomenon, the occurrence of wildfires in California continues to have a strongly seasonal pattern—primarily occurring during the summer and fall months when the weather is the driest Figure 2 shows the average number of wildfires by month across the last five years compared to the ten‑year average, along with the number of wildfires by month in the severe 2018 and 2020 wildfire seasons. As the figure shows, wildfire activity is relatively low from December through March and reaches its peak from June through August each year. While generally fewer wildfires occur in the fall (as compared to summer), these fires can be particularly severe because forests are dry after little to no rainfall during the summer, as well as due to other autumn weather conditions such as high winds. \n\nIncrease in Wildfires Has Led to Concerns About State’s Preparedness and Demands on Firefighters. Recent increases in large and severe wildfires have raised concerns about the state’s capacity to adequately respond to these growing threats, particularly when multiple large wildfires occur simultaneously as has happened in recent years. Responding to these large and severe wildfires has imposed significant burdens on firefighters—many of whom have been required to work long stretches without breaks. This, in turn, has led to concerns about the mental and physical health and wellness of the firefighters who are on the frontlines of these events. These issues have been highlighted in the media—such as in a series of articles published in 2022 by CalMatters.\nLegislature Has Taken Various Actions to Respond to Concerns. The Legislature has taken a number of actions in response to these growing concerns, including to improve the health and wellness of firefighters.", "title": "The 2024-25 Budget: CalFire—Implementation of a 66-Hour Workweek"}, {"document_id": "031693dc1490c39e-4593-6990", "source": "", "score": 13.370842, "text": "Wildfires - NYSDEC\nWildfires, often called forest fires, damage thousands of acres of natural resources most every year in New York. Although wildfires naturally occur from lightning, human activities are the cause of most wildfires (PDF). To protect our natural resources and communities from wildfire damage, residents, visitors, and municipal jurisdictions must contribute to wildfire prevention and fire containment.\n\nWildfire terms definedWildfires are unplanned or unwanted fires burning vegetation in areas where growth is minimal or non-existent. They may also be referred to asforest fires;brush fires;grass fires;range fires;ground fires; orcrown fires.Wildland Fires include wildfires and those fires intentionally set or allowed to burn according to a recognized land management plan and are commonly referred to as prescribed fires or controlled burns.Wildland-Urban Interface Fires are wildfires that burn or threaten to burn buildings and other structures.Wildfire Mitigation is the activity of reducing the risk of wildfires and their associated property loss, forest damage, and sometimes loss of life.Wildland Fire Management is activity related to wildfire mitigation and the use of prescribed fire to accomplish ecological goals.Wildfire OccurrenceAccording to Forest Rangers Division wildfire occurrence data from 1993-2017 (PDF), wildfires in New York State are caused by the following.95% by humans.Lightning is responsible for 5%.Debris burning accounts for 33%.Incendiary fires account for 16%.Campfires cause 16%.Children are responsible for 4%.Smoking, equipment, railroads, and miscellaneous causes contribute to the remaining 25% of wildfires.Beginning in 2010, New York enacted revised open burning regulations that ban brush burning statewide from March 15 through May 15, a period when 47% of all fire department-response wildfires occur. Forest ranger data indicates that this new statewide ban resulted in 46% fewer spring wildfires caused by debris burning in upstate New York from 2010-2017 when compared to the previous 8-year average. Debris burning has been prohibited in New York City and Long Island for more than 40 years.\n\nWildland Fire Management in New YorkNew York state is 30.9 million acres in size with 18.9 million acres of non-federal forested lands.

Although wildfires naturally occur from lightning, human activities are the cause of most wildfires (PDF). To protect our natural resources and communities from wildfire damage, residents, visitors, and municipal jurisdictions must contribute to wildfire prevention and fire containment.\n\nWildfire terms definedWildfires are unplanned or unwanted fires burning vegetation in areas where growth is minimal or non-existent. They may also be referred to asforest fires;brush fires;grass fires;range fires;ground fires; orcrown fires.Wildland Fires include wildfires and those fires intentionally set or allowed to burn according to a recognized land management plan and are commonly referred to as prescribed fires or controlled burns.Wildland-Urban Interface Fires are wildfires that burn or threaten to burn buildings and other structures.Wildfire Mitigation is the activity of reducing the risk of wildfires and their associated property loss, forest damage, and sometimes loss of life.Wildland Fire Management is activity related to wildfire mitigation and the use of prescribed fire to accomplish ecological goals.Wildfire OccurrenceAccording to Forest Rangers Division wildfire occurrence data from 1993-2017 (PDF), wildfires in New York State are caused by the following.95% by humans.Lightning is responsible for 5%.Debris burning accounts for 33%.Incendiary fires account for 16%.Campfires cause 16%.Children are responsible for 4%.Smoking, equipment, railroads, and miscellaneous causes contribute to the remaining 25% of wildfires.Beginning in 2010, New York enacted revised open burning regulations that ban brush burning statewide from March 15 through May 15, a period when 47% of all fire department-response wildfires occur. Forest ranger data indicates that this new statewide ban resulted in 46% fewer spring wildfires caused by debris burning in upstate New York from 2010-2017 when compared to the previous 8-year average. Debris burning has been prohibited in New York City and Long Island for more than 40 years.\n\nWildland Fire Management in New YorkNew York state is 30.9 million acres in size with 18.9 million acres of non-federal forested lands.

We’ve seen lower rainfall and lower river levels and water tables—conditions that made it more likely that fires could escape their intended boundaries and burn into standing Amazon rainforest.”\nIt is possible to identify some understory forest fires with the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) sensors on the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites, but it’s challenging for satellites to detect all of them because they often burn beneath dense canopy. Sensors on Landsat 8 and 9 and the Sentinel-2 satellites offer more detailed observations than VIIRS and can sometimes detect understory fires, though they pass over the Amazon basin less frequently than VIIRS.\nThe false-color image above, captured by the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) sensor on Landsat 9, shows an example of several understory fires burning in densely forested areas south of Manaus. The use of the sensor’s observations in the shortwave infrared makes it easier to identify fires.\n“Understory fires are lose-lose: they degrade the value of forests and contribute to climate change,” added Morton. “We’ve been working as quickly as possible to get data from the SERVIR Amazon Fire Dashboard and several satellites about the location of these fires to fire brigades on the ground to support suppression efforts as quickly as possible. This is an all-hands-on-deck situation.”\nNASA Earth Observatory images by Lauren Dauphin, using MODIS data from NASA EOSDIS LANCE and GIBS/Worldview and Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey.

Smoke impacts to surrounding communities are being carefully monitored.\nWith its 14 spectral bands from the visible to the thermal infrared wavelength region and its high spatial resolution of about 50 to 300 feet (15 to 91 meters), ASTER images Earth to map and monitor the changing surface of our planet.

A joint U.S./Japan science team is responsible for validation and calibration of the instrument and data products.\nThe broad spectral coverage and high spectral resolution of ASTER provides scientists in numerous disciplines with critical information for surface mapping and monitoring of dynamic conditions and temporal change. Example applications are monitoring glacial advances and retreats; monitoring potentially active volcanoes; identifying crop stress; determining cloud morphology and physical properties; wetlands evaluation; thermal pollution monitoring; coral reef degradation; surface temperature mapping of soils and geology; and measuring surface heat balance.\nThe U.S. science team is located at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.

These fires are regulated by law and regulation and require technical expertise to conduct the burns safely.Support to New YorkSome years, when wildfire occurrence is high, fire departments and forest rangers need help to control them.

Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water.Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery ONLY outdoors and away from windows.\n\nAssociated Content\nFlood Information Sheet (PDF)Protective Actions Research for FloodNational Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)Flood Safety Social Media ToolkitNational Weather Service Weather Ready Nation Spring Safety Outreach MaterialsFlood Insurance FactsSix Things to Know Before a Disaster (Video)When the Cloud Forms (Video)How to Prepare for a FloodFile A Flood Insurance ClaimYour Homeowners Insurance Does Not Cover Flood (PDF)American Red Cross\n\nLast Updated: 03/21/2024\n\nReturn to top\n\nDisasters and Emergencies\n\nMake a Plan\n\nGet Involved\n\nReady Business\n\nReady Kids\n\nResources\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nYouTube\n\nContact Ready \n\n \n\nReady.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nCareers\nContact Us\nFOIA\nGlossary\nNo FEAR Act\nPlug-Ins\nPrivacy\nReport Disaster Fraud\nWebsite Information\nDHS.gov\nUSA.gov\nInspector General\n\nThis site works best with Javascript enabled.", "title": "Floods | Ready.gov"}, {"document_id": "89c8998bbb932fff-0-2046", "source": "", "score": 8.610767, "text": "FEMA: Flood\n\n\nFEMA: Flood\n\nContact Us\nSite Map\nFrequently Asked Questions\nEspañol\n\nSearch\n\n Advanced Search\n\nHome\nDisaster Information\nPlan Ahead\nApply for Assistance\nRecover & Rebuild\nAbout Us\n\nDisaster Information\nTypes of Disasters\nFlood\n\nFlood Maps\nFlood Terms\nBefore a Flood\nDuring a Flood\nAfter a Flood\n\nFlood\n\nFloods are one of the most common hazards in the United States. Flood effects can be local, impacting a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins and multiple states.\nHowever, all floods are not alike. Some floods develop slowly, sometimes over a period of days. But flash floods can develop quickly, sometimes in just a few minutes and without any visible signs of rain. Flash floods often have a dangerous wall of roaring water that carries rocks, mud, and other debris and can sweep away most things in its path. Overland flooding occurs outside a defined river or stream, such as when a levee is breached, but still can be destructive. Flooding can also occur when a dam breaks, producing effects similar to flash floods.\nBe aware of flood hazards no matter where you live, but especially if you live in a low-lying area, near water or downstream from a dam. Even very small streams, gullies, creeks, culverts, dry streambeds, or low-lying ground that appear harmless in dry weather can flood. Every state is at risk from this hazard.\nWhat is the flood risk where I live?\nHow can I protect myself from a flood?\n\nKnow your flood terms\nWhat to do before a flood\nWhat to do during a flood\nWhat to do after a flood\n\nLast Modified: Friday, 13-Jun-2008 13:32:33 EDT\n\nFast Facts\nLearn about flood risk and flood insurance\nSignificant Flood Events\nFlood Health Risks\n\nSolutions\n\nRepair Flood Damage\nBuy Flood Insurance\n\nOnline Tools\n\nMap Service Center\n\nRelated Topics\n\nFlood Photos\nFloodplain Management\nFlood Hazard Mapping\n\nHome\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nImportant Notices\nFOIA\nNo FEAR Act Data\nUSA.gov\nDHS\n\nFEMA 500 C Street SW, Washington, D.C. 20472Disaster Assistance: (800) 621-FEMA, TTY (800) 462-7585\n\n \n\n", "title": "FEMA: Flood"}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "I do not have the answer to your question.", "metadata": {"author_type": "model", "author_id": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01", "created_at": 1723128860}}], "predictions": [{"text": "I'm sorry, but I don't have the answer to your question."}]}

Get flood coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).\n\nPreparing for a FloodMake a plan for your household, including your pets, so that you and your family know what to do, where to go, and what you will need to protect yourselves from flooding. Learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response.

At school, children may hear inaccurate information from peers. They may display a wide range of reactions—sadness, generalized fear, or specific fears of the disaster happening again, guilt over action or inaction during the disaster, anger that the event was not prevented, or fantasies of playing rescuer.\nPre-adolescence to adolescence - 11 through 18 years. As children grow older, they develop a more sophisticated understanding of the disaster event. Their responses are more similar to adults. Teenagers may become involved in dangerous, risk-taking behaviors, such as reckless driving, or alcohol or drug use. Others can become fearful of leaving home and avoid previous levels of activities. Much of adolescence is focused on moving out into the world. After a trauma, the view of the world can seem more dangerous and unsafe. A teenager may feel overwhelmed by intense emotions and yet feel unable to discuss them with others.\nBack To Top\n\nMeeting the Child’s Emotional Needs\nChildren’s reactions are influenced by the behavior, thoughts, and feelings of adults. Adults should encourage children and adolescents to share their thoughts and feelings about the incident. Clarify misunderstandings about risk and danger by listening to children’s concerns and answering questions. Maintain a sense of calm by validating children’s concerns and perceptions and with discussion of concrete plans for safety.\nListen to what the child is saying. If a young child is asking questions about the event, answer them simply without the elaboration needed for an older child or adult. Some children are comforted by knowing more or less information than others; decide what level of information your particular child needs. If a child has difficulty expressing feelings, allow the child to draw a picture or tell a story of what happened.\nTry to understand what is causing anxieties and fears. Be aware that following a disaster, children are most afraid that:\n\nThe event will happen again.\nSomeone close to them will be killed or injured.\nThey will be left alone or separated from the family.\n\nBack To Top\n\nReassuring Children After a Disaster\nSuggestions to help reassure children include the following:\n\nPersonal contact is reassuring.", "title": "FEMA: Helping Children Cope with Disaster"}, {"document_id": "e24601ea68d43eae-1565-3874", "source": "", "score": 8.986131, "text": "FEMA: Helping Children Cope with Disaster\nWho is at Risk?\nFor many children, reactions to disasters are brief and represent normal reactions to \"abnormal events.\" A smaller number of children can be at risk for more enduring psychological distress as a function of three major risk factors:\n\nDirect exposure to the disaster, such as being evacuated, observing injuries or death of others, or experiencing injury along with fearing one’s life is in danger.\nLoss/grief: This relates to the death or serious injury of family or friends.\nOn-going stress from the secondary effects of disaster, such as temporarily living elsewhere, loss of friends and social networks, loss of personal property, parental unemployment, and costs incurred during recovery to return the family to pre-disaster life and living conditions.\n\nBack To Top\n\nWhat Creates Vulnerabilities in Children?\nIn most cases, depending on the risk factors above, distressing responses are temporary. In the absence of severe threat to life, injury, loss of loved ones, or secondary problems such as loss of home, moves, etc., symptoms usually diminish over time. For those that were directly exposed to the disaster, reminders of the disaster such as high winds, smoke, cloudy skies, sirens, or other reminders of the disaster may cause upsetting feelings to return. Having a prior history of some type of traumatic event or severe stress may contribute to these feelings.\nChildren’s coping with disaster or emergencies is often tied to the way parents cope. They can detect adults’ fears and sadness. Parents and adults can make disasters less traumatic for children by taking steps to manage their own feelings and plans for coping. Parents are almost always the best source of support for children in disasters. One way to establish a sense of control and to build confidence in children before a disaster is to engage and involve them in preparing a family disaster plan. After a disaster, children can contribute to a family recovery plan.\nBack To Top\n\nA Child’s Reaction to Disaster by Age\nBelow are common reactions in children after a disaster or traumatic event.\nBirth through 2 years.

While the term \"global warming\" refers to the long-term warming of the planet from excess GHG emissions, the term \"climate change\" refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to the earth, including sea level rise, shrinking glaciers, ocean acidification, desertification, more intense storm activities, and shifts in plant blooming times. Increased warming of the Earth's oceans and the atmosphere is driving climate change by affecting the way heat and moisture are moved through the climate system by air and ocean currents, changing patterns of precipitation, temperatures, storms, and even sea level all around the globe.Ocean WarmingOceans cover 70% of the Earth's surface and can absorb large amounts of solar energy. Heat and moisture are moved by ocean currents and atmospheric circulation, influencing the climate around the planet.The oceans have a large capacity for absorbing and holding heat. For decades, the oceans have taken up more than 90% of excess heat from the atmosphere. If not for the ability of Earth's oceans to absorb such large amounts of heat, the atmosphere would warm at a much faster rate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 6th Assessment Report (AR6) finds that the rate of ocean warming observed since 1971 will at least double by the year 2100, even if GHG emissions are reduced. Ocean temperature plays an important role in the Earth's climate system, particularly sea surface temperature (SST). SST has risen as oceans absorb more heat from the atmosphere, resulting in changes to ocean currents and circulation, as well as sea level rise. SST has a significant impact on climate. As SST rises, increased evaporation leads to a greater concentration of water vapor over the oceans, influencing weather systems that produce precipitation or contribute to drought conditions.", "title": "Climate Change - NYSDEC"}, {"document_id": "5306392549c81595-11843-14136", "source": "", "score": 9.022875, "text": "Global Warming\nAfter that point, the decadal trend in global surface warming cannot be explained without including the contribution of the greenhouse gases added by humans.\nThough people have had the largest impact on our climate since 1950, natural changes to Earth’s climate have also occurred in recent times. For example, two major volcanic eruptions, El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991, pumped sulfur dioxide gas high into the atmosphere. The gas was converted into tiny particles that lingered for more than a year, reflecting sunlight and shading Earth’s surface. Temperatures across the globe dipped for two to three years.\n\nAlthough Earth’s temperature fluctuates naturally, human influence on climate has eclipsed the magnitude of natural temperature changes over the past 120 years. Natural influences on temperature—El Niño, solar variability, and volcanic aerosols—have varied approximately plus and minus 0.2° C (0.4° F), (averaging to about zero), while human influences have contributed roughly 0.8° C (1° F) of warming since 1889. (Graphs adapted from Lean et al., 2008.)\n\nAlthough volcanoes are active around the world, and continue to emit carbon dioxide as they did in the past, the amount of carbon dioxide they release is extremely small compared to human emissions. On average, volcanoes emit between 130 and 230 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. By burning fossil fuels, people release in excess of 100 times more, about 26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere every year (as of 2005). As a result, human activity overshadows any contribution volcanoes may have made to recent global warming.\nChanges in the brightness of the Sun can influence the climate from decade to decade, but an increase in solar output falls short as an explanation for recent warming. NASA satellites have been measuring the Sun’s output since 1978. The total energy the Sun radiates varies over an 11-year cycle. During solar maxima, solar energy is approximately 0.1 percent higher on average than it is during solar minima.\n\nThe transparent halo known as the solar corona changes between solar maximum (left) and solar minimum (right).

Climate is influenced by the movement of heat and moisture by air and ocean currents, which can affect the temperatures, precipitation, humidity, soil moisture, surface water levels, groundwater levels, and even storm events of a particular region.Climate change refers to long-term changes in the average weather patterns that define the Earth's global, regional and local climates. Often when we think of climate change, we think of the physical effects of climate change such as heatwaves, sea level rise, and heavy rainfall, and the impacts on communities and the environment, such as floods and droughts.Some climate change is influenced by naturally occurring changes in the Earth's temperature. For at least the last million years, the Earth has experienced natural cycles of cooling and warming, taking the Earth into ice ages and warming it up again. Each of these naturally-occurring cycles has taken approximately 100,000 years to complete.However, today's climate is changing much more rapidly because of greenhouse gas emissions released from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, wetland loss, and other human activities that are causing the Earth's average temperature to heat up much faster than it would naturally.The Greenhouse Effect, Greenhouse Gases, and Global Warming\n\n \n\nEnergy from the sun, or solar radiation, travels through space and enters the Earth's atmosphere, which forms a kind of warm blanket around the Earth. Some solar radiation remains trapped in the atmosphere under this blanket and is absorbed by land, air, and surface waters, while some solar radiation is reflected by land, ice, or clouds and escapes back out into space. When the Earth reflects the same amount of energy as it absorbs, the balance keeps the planet's average temperature fairly stable. This is called the greenhouse effect, and is essential for sustaining life on Earth. The revolution of the Earth around the sun and the tilt of the Earth on its axis create variation in the intensity of solar radiation received by different sections of the planet and drive naturally occurring cycles of planetary cooling and warming. This variation over time is what sends the Earth into ice ages and then into shorter warming periods between these ice ages.", "title": "Climate Change - NYSDEC", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "28f6abec5bb810ba-10637-13093", "source": "", "score": 8.9058695, "text": "Climate Change - NYSDEC\nOcean temperature plays an important role in the Earth's climate system, particularly sea surface temperature (SST).

As SST rises, increased evaporation leads to a greater concentration of water vapor over the oceans, influencing weather systems that produce precipitation or contribute to drought conditions. Heat from water at the ocean's surface provides tropical storms and hurricanes with energy and influences weather patterns.The U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports that over the last two decades the Atlantic Ocean along the northeastern United States (U.S.) has warmed faster than 99% of the global ocean. Coastal temperatures along the northeastern U.S. increased by 0.06°F per year from 1982 to 2016. Ocean temperatures over the Northeastern continental shelf are expected to warm by up to 0.76°F per decade by 2070.Ocean circulation plays an important role in climate through the movement of heat, freshwater, nutrients, and carbon. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) moves warm water from the tropics poleward and cold water from the poles towards the equator, largely influencing the climates of North America and Europe. However, warming ocean temperatures and changes in ocean salinity due to an influx of freshwater from melting sea ice and glaciers, can slow down the AMOC. The amount and velocity of heat transported by AMOC can be a cause for extreme weather and changes to precipitation patterns experienced by these continents.Increasing ocean temperatures can also create disturbances to marine ecosystems and the loss of essential habitats for marine fish and mammals. The loss of coral reef habitat from coral bleaching is a result of warming ocean temperatures. Pathogens, such as harmful algal blooms and bacteria, can spread more easily in warmer waters, putting global water supplies, human and animal health, and economies that depend on the fishing industry, at risk.Ocean AcidificationHigh levels of GHGs in the atmosphere are not only increasing global warming and intensifying climate change but are also threatening the health of ocean life and ecosystems.

Rain and snowmelt comes down from the San Gabriel Mountains through a series of dams and are then diverted to \"spreading basins\". Spreading basins are designated areas of land that are very permeable, such as sand and gravel areas.

Stormwater pollution comes from numerous sources, but many can be reduced or eliminated through small actions taken around your home, yard and business.\nMaking small changes such as using organic pesticides and fertilizers, keeping your vehicle clean and maintained, picking up after your pet, ensuring trash is properly disposed of, securing items in your truck-bed can truly reduce stormwater pollution where you live.\n\nStormwater Links\n\nAbout Stormwater\nPollutants\nResources\nGet Involved\nOur Partners\n\nHere’s a few tips to get you started:\n\n1.\n\nProperly Dispose Of Trash And Litter\nDispose trash and recycling items in a waste or recycling receptacle. If it’s left lying around, it can blow away or fall to the ground and end up in stormwater. Common trash and litter pollutants include:\n\nFood wrappers or packaging\nPlastic containers\nCigarette butts\nSingle-use items\nFace masks or gloves\n\n2.\n\nClean Out Your Vehicle And Truck Beds\nTrash, recyclables and other debris can fall out of an open window or truck bed. Keep a small litter bag in your car, and put items in the garbage can when you get home or visit a gas station. These are some of the common items that can fly out of a vehicle in motion:\n\nFood wrappers or packaging\nEmpty beverage containers\nPlastic containers\nRecreational items\nLandscape waste\n\n3.\n\nSecure Your Load\nMake sure items in your truck bed are secured with tarps and tie-downs or a cargo net.

It’s also from snow and ice melt that drips off roofs, cars and vegetation, and then runs onto driveways, walkways and roads. Another source is from irrigation and over watering of vegetation that runs into streets.\nThis excess water flows into the storm drain inlets built into our roadways. Stormwater systems were originally intended to route rainwater quickly off the streets during a heavy storm. Drains carry water through a system of pipes, emptying into the nearest body of water.\nHere are ways you can help prevent stormwater pollution:\n\nPlan ahead when traveling with pets, their waste needs to be properly disposed.\nKeep your tires properly inflated to prevent wear and tear and reduce heavy metal pollution. Plus, you’ll get better gas mileage.\nRegularly maintain vehicles to prevent auto fluid leaks from dripping onto roadways.\nWipe down tire wheel wells to remove brake dust. Copper metals found in brakes are a major pollutant.\nKeep your vehicle clean and use a car wash facility that recycles their water.\nChoose to use non-toxic products in your home’s outdoor spaces, and never apply them before wind or rain are in the forecast.\nProperly dispose of trash and recycling. This includes cigarette butts, which are the number one littered item.\nAlways secure vehicle loads to reduce debris and roadway hazards.\n\nWhy does stormwater matter?", "title": "About Stormwater | Caltrans"}, {"document_id": "5ed8d5fe6c497e3d-9783-11678", "source": "", "score": 7.345447, "text": "Reporting Dead Wildlife - NYSDEC\nArea should be inaccessible to children or domestic animals.You can have a NWCO (Nuisance Wildlife Control Operator) Licensed Company come out for a fee and remove the wildlife for you.Disinfection ProceduresIn case of exposure or contamination:Skin: Wash skin thoroughly with hot water and soap.

Average use per person is 100-110 gallons per day.\t\n\n5.\nWhat is ground water?\n\r\nContrary to what a lot of people think, groundwater is not found in underground rivers or lakes. Rather, it is water that fills the cracks and pore spaces in rocks and sediments that lie beneath the surface of the earth, much the way water fills the open spaces and saturates a sponge or towel. \t\n\n6.\nWhy is keeping our groundwater clean so important?\n\r\nThe San Gabriel Valley is unique in that it is one of the few natural underground reservoirs in the United States. Rain and snowmelt comes down from the San Gabriel Mountains through a series of dams and are then diverted to \"spreading basins\". Spreading basins are designated areas of land that are very permeable, such as sand and gravel areas. Water can then percolate into the ground. 100% of the water served to residents and businesses in Monterey Park comes from groundwater. Thus, keeping our groundwater resource clean is vitally important to all of us. \t\n\n7.\nWhere do groundwater toxins come from?\n\r\nMany products we use around our homes everyday are considered toxic, such as household cleaners, flea powders, garden pesticides, paints, varnishes, motor oil, and antifreeze. These products are not only hazardous to our health, but to our environment. By disposing these harmful products improperly, we are contributing to the groundwater contamination in the San Gabriel Valley.\t\n\n8.\nCan contaminated groundwater be cleaned up?\n\r\nYes, but it can be time-consuming and expensive. Communities whose drinking water source has become contaminated have had to spend millions of dollars to remove contaminants from the water before it can be piped to homes and businesses. The cleanup is effective, but it can significantly affect the cost of providing the water to customers.", "title": "FAQs • Where do groundwater toxins come from?", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "b4521304b77788b6-4612-6743", "source": "", "score": 11.446406, "text": "FAQs • Where do groundwater toxins come from?\nBy disposing these harmful products improperly, we are contributing to the groundwater contamination in the San Gabriel Valley.\t\n\n8.\nCan contaminated groundwater be cleaned up?\n\r\nYes, but it can be time-consuming and expensive.

It is far better to prevent contamination in the first place. What are the dos and do nots for groundwater?Do: Purchase only what you need Use products completely before disposing Recycle whatever you can (oil, batteries, etc.) Recycle surplus paintsDo not: Dump products onto the ground (they can contaminate soil and groundwater) Pour products or wastes into the street (they can contaminate oceans, lakes, and groundwater) Put hazardous or toxic products in the trash Pour products down the drainView proper disposal of Household Hazardous Wastes online. \n\n9.\nIs our water fluoridated?\n\r\nAt this time fluoride is not added to the water. There are low levels of fluoride naturally occurring in the water. The range at which they occur is between 0.2 to 0.8 milligrams per liter (mg/L). The optimum fluoride level recommended to reduce dental caries (cavities) is a consistent .8 mg/L does. A bill signed by Governor Wilson in 1997 mandates drinking water fluoridation for larger water utilities, including Monterey Park, and requires the state to provide funding for the installation and operation of fluoridation equipment. The state is currently seeking funding for this program.\t\n\n10.\nDoes the City of Monterey Park own the Garvey Reservoir?\n\r\nThe Garvey Reservoir is not owned by the City of Monterey Park and the water it contains is not stored for city use.\t\n\nLive Edit\n\n \n\n \n\nCoronavirus Updates\n\nAgenda Center\n\nDocuments Prior to 2012\n\nTeleconference Procedures\n\nCity Council Meetings Written Communications / Addendums\n\nWritten Communications / Addendums 2024\n\nWritten Communications / Addendums 2023", "title": "FAQs • Where do groundwater toxins come from?"}, {"document_id": "b4521304b77788b6-2-2025", "source": "", "score": 11.109868, "text": "FAQs • Where do groundwater toxins come from?\nFAQs • Where do groundwater toxins come from?\n\n \n\nSkip to Main Content\n\nCreate a Website Account - Manage notification subscriptions, save form progress and more.   \n\nWebsite Sign In\n\n \n\n 中文 Español\n\n \n \n \n\nGovernmentServicesResidentsVisitorsBusinessHow Do I...\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nSearch\n\n \n \n \n\n \nHomeFAQs\n\nSearch\n\nAll categories\nCode Enforcement\nConstruction Inspections\nDrone FAQs\nElection Information (English)\nFire Department\nLibrary\nMulti-Family Residential/Apartment Inspection Program\nPlanning\nPublic Works - Slurry Seal\nWater\n\nCategories\n\nAll Categories\n\nCode Enforcement\n\nConstruction Inspections\n\nDrone FAQs\n\nElection Information (English)\n\nFire Department\n\nLibrary\n\nMulti-Family Residential/Apartment Inspection Program\n\nPlanning\n\nPublic Works - Slurry Seal\n\nWater\n\n \n\r\nWhere do groundwater toxins come from?\t\n\r\nMany products we use around our homes everyday are considered toxic, such as household cleaners, flea powders, garden pesticides, paints, varnishes, motor oil, and antifreeze.

A TMDL is developed for each pollutant contributing to the impairment of a listed water body. The development of a TMDL involves the following\r\nsteps:\n\nDetermination of how much of a particular pollutant a water body can receive from all sources and still meet water quality standards. \nDetermination of how much of the existing level of pollution must be reduced to meet water quality standards. \nAllocation of responsibility for reducing pollution to the acceptable level among the various contributing sources, including both point and nonpoint sources.\nDevelopment of a plan to implement the TMDL. While implementation plans are not currently a federal requirement, federal regulations effective later this\r\nyear will require these plans. \nAdoption of a regulation (a \"basin plan amendment\") to establish actions to implement a TMDL, such as revising permits to control waste discharges. \n\nWhen a listed water body later meets water quality standards, it is \"de-listed.\" Neither state nor federal law specifies a time schedule for the development or\r\nimplementation of TMDLs or for when listed water bodies should become de-listed. Only three of the 18 impaired water bodies on the state's initial list from\r\n1976 have been de-listed.\nState Versus Federal Role. The state is primarily responsible for compiling the list of impaired water bodies and developing TMDLs.

Reduce water pollution by sweeping your driveway instead of using the hose and, if you can, by washing your car at a facility. The United States Environmental Protection Agency warns that washing cars and driveways at home can cause pollution as metals and fluids are washed off and enter storm drains, collecting more pollutants along the way and ending up in our waterways. If you can, choose car wash facilities that use advanced filtration systems to recycle water used for washing cars.\nGo organic. This summer consider using natural pest control methods instead of harmful pesticides. Pesticides made from highly toxic chemicals can have long-lasting effects on the health of our water and the environment. By choosing organic alternatives, like companion planting or using beneficial insects like ladybugs, you can make a difference.\nGive your vehicle a tune-up.

(It can’t orbit Europa because doing so would bring Europa Clipper too close to the gas giant’s brutal radiation belts. Learn more in the video.) On each flyby, a suite of science instruments will gather data on how deep the subsurface ocean is, how thick the ice crust is, and, potentially, the characteristics of any plumes that may be venting subsurface water into space. The goal is to find out whether Europa has the potential to support life.\nThe series’ premiere episode features Europa Clipper Project Manager Jordan Evans, who also has worked on NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover and the agency’s Hubble Space Telescope. In the video, he joins Deputy Science Manager Trina Ray, who worked on NASA’s Cassini and Galileo missions. They venture into JPL’s storied High Bay 1 clean room, where the Europa Clipper spacecraft is under construction – and where all of NASA’s Mars rovers, the twin Voyager spacecraft, and other historic spacecraft were assembled.\nWhile you’re digging into the nuts and bolts of the spacecraft, check out a 24-hour live feed of assembly in progress in High Bay 1.\nAdditional episodes of “Spacecraft Makers” will include more activity inside other clean rooms where components of Europa Clipper are coming together.

Landing on Mars is notoriously difficult. But Mars offers a more tolerable environment than Venus for any plucky probes that reach the Martian surface intact. Generations of rovers and landers have taught us much about the Red Planet. A few billion years ago, an ocean may have covered one-fifth of the Martian surface. Indeed, scientists think Mars was once habitable. Then, over millions of years, Mars lost most of the water that was on its surface. Solar wind and radiation stripped away the Martian atmosphere. An ocean world that could have supported life is now a frigid, nearly airless desert.\nBut more exotic worlds farther from the Sun host vast oceans in the present day. Europa is one of those worlds.\nIt Matters Where We Find Life\nAround most stars is a region where conditions are just right for an orbiting planet to have liquid water on its surface. That region is the star’s habitable zone or \"Goldilocks zone.” But scientists have learned that worlds outside the Goldilocks zone can have liquid oceans as well, including several moons in our outer solar system.\nSome moons of Saturn and Jupiter (including Europa, we suspect) are ocean worlds – they have oceans beneath their icy surfaces. In fact, finding life in one of these oceans might be more consequential than finding life on Mars. It could change how humans understand the equation for life in the cosmos.\n\nIn theory, even simple lifeforms can travel from one planet to another. A meteorite collides with a planet and ejects surface material containing microbes. The rocky chunks float through space until some collide with another planet. Life then springs forth on a new world.\nIf life existed on Earth and Mars, it didn’t necessarily start on both worlds. Instead, life may have evolved on one of the two planets, then traveled to the other. We know the two planets swap rocks because Mars rocks have been found on Earth.\nThe outer solar system is another story.", "title": "Europa: A World of Ice, With Potential for Life – NASA's Europa Clipper"}, {"document_id": "0a437f6bacf55ac9-2-1972", "source": "", "score": 10.638534, "text": "Europa: A World of Ice, With Potential for Life – NASA's Europa Clipper\nEuropa: A World of Ice, With Potential for Life – NASA's Europa Clipper\n\nNASA\n\nEuropa Clipper\n\nSkip Navigation\n\nmenu\n\nclose modal\n\nNews\n\n| June 8, 2021\n\nEuropa: A World of Ice, With Potential for Life\n\nJupiter’s icy moon Europa may be the most promising place in the solar system to find present-day environments suitable for life beyond Earth.\nScientists study the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe in a scientific field called astrobiology. They’ve found that life as we know it requires three main ingredients: temperatures that allow liquid water to exist; the presence of carbon-based molecules; and an energy input, such as sunlight.\nEuropa seems to have all three ingredients. But to understand why it’s a uniquely captivating target for astrobiology, it helps to know a bit about a few other moons and planets in the solar system. The story starts with water.\nProbing Planets’ Pasts\nAlmost everywhere we find water on Earth, we also find life. So water’s presence or absence is an initial way to assess a world’s habitability. As it happens, Earth’s planetary neighbors may have once been wetter.\nFor as long as 2 billion years, liquid water may have covered much of the surface of Venus. But today Venus is a hellscape. The planet’s atmospheric pressure would crush a human, and temperatures reach 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius). Even if evidence for life were sitting on the planet’s surface, searching for it would be challenging. The planet’s climate is nearly as damaging to robotic probes as it would be to humans.\n\nMars is more merciful. Landing on Mars is notoriously difficult.

Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nNASA has selected Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) of Hawthorne, California, to provide launch services for Earth’s first mission to conduct detailed investigations of Jupiter's moon Europa.\nThe Europa Clipper mission will launch in October 2024 on a Falcon Heavy rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The total contract award amount for launch services is approximately $178 million.\nEuropa Clipper will conduct a detailed survey of Europa and use a sophisticated suite of science instruments to investigate whether the icy moon has conditions suitable for life. Key mission objectives are to produce high-resolution images of Europa's surface, determine its composition, look for signs of recent or ongoing geological activity, measure the thickness of the moon’s icy shell, search for subsurface lakes, and determine the depth and salinity of Europa's ocean.\nNASA’s Launch Services Program at Kennedy will manage the Europa Clipper launch service.
