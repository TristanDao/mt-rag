Be aware that some earthquakes are actually foreshocks and a larger earthquake might occur. Minimize your movements to a few steps to a nearby safe place and stay indoors until the shaking has stopped and you are sure exiting is safe.\nIf indoors\n\nDROP to the ground; take COVER by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and HOLD ON on until the shaking stops. If there isn’t a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.\nStay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture.\nStay in bed if you are there when the earthquake strikes. Hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place.\nUse a doorway for shelter only if it is in close proximity to you and if you know it is a strongly supported, loadbearing doorway.\nStay inside until shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave.\nBe aware that the electricity may go out or the sprinkler systems or fire alarms may turn on.\nDO NOT use the elevators.\n\nIf outdoors\n\nStay there.\nMove away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires.\nOnce in the open, stay there until the shaking stops. The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings, at exits, and alongside exterior walls. Many of the 120 fatalities from the 1933 Long Beach earthquake occurred when people ran outside of buildings only to be killed by falling debris from collapsing walls.", "title": "FEMA: What to Do During an Earthquake"}, {"document_id": "e37ec44b3e6d0142-2-2068", "source": "", "score": 7.7413216, "text": "FEMA: What to Do After an Earthquake\nFEMA: What to Do After an Earthquake\n\nContact Us\nSite Map\nFrequently Asked Questions\nEspañol\n\nSearch\n\n Advanced Search\n\nHome\nDisaster Information\nPlan Ahead\nApply for Assistance\nRecover & Rebuild\nAbout Us\n\nDisaster Information\nTypes of Disasters\nEarthquake\n\nBefore an Earthquake\nDuring an Earthquake\nAfter an Earthquake\nEarthquake Terms\n\nWhat to Do After an Earthquake\n\nExpect aftershocks. These secondary shockwaves are usually less violent than the main quake but can be strong enough to do additional damage to weakened structures and can occur in the first hours, days, weeks, or even months after the quake.\n\nListen to a battery-operated radio or television. Listen for the latest emergency information.\n\nUse the telephone only for emergency calls.\n\nOpen cabinets cautiously. Beware of objects that can fall off shelves.\n\nStay away from damaged areas. Stay away unless your assistance has been specifically requested by police, fire, or relief organizations. Return home only when authorities say it is safe.\n\nBe aware of possible tsunamis if you live in coastal areas. These are also known as seismic sea waves (mistakenly called \"tidal waves\"). When local authorities issue a tsunami warning, assume that a series of dangerous waves is on the way. Stay away from the beach.\n\nHelp injured or trapped persons. Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance such as infants, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Give first aid where appropriate. Do not move seriously injured persons unless they are in immediate danger of further injury. Call for help.\n\nClean up spilled medicines, bleaches, gasoline or other flammable liquids immediately.

A few key factors have contributed to the recent increase in large and destructive wildfires, including climate change, poor forest and land management practices, and increased development in fire‑prone areas. \n\nWhile Annual Wildfire Seasons Have Lengthened, Strong Seasonal Pattern Still Exists. Despite recent years having particularly large and destructive wildfires and concerns about wildfires becoming a year‑round phenomenon, the occurrence of wildfires in California continues to have a strongly seasonal pattern—primarily occurring during the summer and fall months when the weather is the driest Figure 2 shows the average number of wildfires by month across the last five years compared to the ten‑year average, along with the number of wildfires by month in the severe 2018 and 2020 wildfire seasons. As the figure shows, wildfire activity is relatively low from December through March and reaches its peak from June through August each year. While generally fewer wildfires occur in the fall (as compared to summer), these fires can be particularly severe because forests are dry after little to no rainfall during the summer, as well as due to other autumn weather conditions such as high winds. \n\nIncrease in Wildfires Has Led to Concerns About State’s Preparedness and Demands on Firefighters. Recent increases in large and severe wildfires have raised concerns about the state’s capacity to adequately respond to these growing threats, particularly when multiple large wildfires occur simultaneously as has happened in recent years. Responding to these large and severe wildfires has imposed significant burdens on firefighters—many of whom have been required to work long stretches without breaks. This, in turn, has led to concerns about the mental and physical health and wellness of the firefighters who are on the frontlines of these events. These issues have been highlighted in the media—such as in a series of articles published in 2022 by CalMatters.\nLegislature Has Taken Various Actions to Respond to Concerns. The Legislature has taken a number of actions in response to these growing concerns, including to improve the health and wellness of firefighters.", "title": "The 2024-25 Budget: CalFire—Implementation of a 66-Hour Workweek"}, {"document_id": "031693dc1490c39e-4593-6990", "source": "", "score": 13.370842, "text": "Wildfires - NYSDEC\nWildfires, often called forest fires, damage thousands of acres of natural resources most every year in New York. Although wildfires naturally occur from lightning, human activities are the cause of most wildfires (PDF). To protect our natural resources and communities from wildfire damage, residents, visitors, and municipal jurisdictions must contribute to wildfire prevention and fire containment.\n\nWildfire terms definedWildfires are unplanned or unwanted fires burning vegetation in areas where growth is minimal or non-existent. They may also be referred to asforest fires;brush fires;grass fires;range fires;ground fires; orcrown fires.Wildland Fires include wildfires and those fires intentionally set or allowed to burn according to a recognized land management plan and are commonly referred to as prescribed fires or controlled burns.Wildland-Urban Interface Fires are wildfires that burn or threaten to burn buildings and other structures.Wildfire Mitigation is the activity of reducing the risk of wildfires and their associated property loss, forest damage, and sometimes loss of life.Wildland Fire Management is activity related to wildfire mitigation and the use of prescribed fire to accomplish ecological goals.Wildfire OccurrenceAccording to Forest Rangers Division wildfire occurrence data from 1993-2017 (PDF), wildfires in New York State are caused by the following.95% by humans.Lightning is responsible for 5%.Debris burning accounts for 33%.Incendiary fires account for 16%.Campfires cause 16%.Children are responsible for 4%.Smoking, equipment, railroads, and miscellaneous causes contribute to the remaining 25% of wildfires.Beginning in 2010, New York enacted revised open burning regulations that ban brush burning statewide from March 15 through May 15, a period when 47% of all fire department-response wildfires occur. Forest ranger data indicates that this new statewide ban resulted in 46% fewer spring wildfires caused by debris burning in upstate New York from 2010-2017 when compared to the previous 8-year average. Debris burning has been prohibited in New York City and Long Island for more than 40 years.\n\nWildland Fire Management in New YorkNew York state is 30.9 million acres in size with 18.9 million acres of non-federal forested lands.

Although wildfires naturally occur from lightning, human activities are the cause of most wildfires (PDF). To protect our natural resources and communities from wildfire damage, residents, visitors, and municipal jurisdictions must contribute to wildfire prevention and fire containment.\n\nWildfire terms definedWildfires are unplanned or unwanted fires burning vegetation in areas where growth is minimal or non-existent. They may also be referred to asforest fires;brush fires;grass fires;range fires;ground fires; orcrown fires.Wildland Fires include wildfires and those fires intentionally set or allowed to burn according to a recognized land management plan and are commonly referred to as prescribed fires or controlled burns.Wildland-Urban Interface Fires are wildfires that burn or threaten to burn buildings and other structures.Wildfire Mitigation is the activity of reducing the risk of wildfires and their associated property loss, forest damage, and sometimes loss of life.Wildland Fire Management is activity related to wildfire mitigation and the use of prescribed fire to accomplish ecological goals.Wildfire OccurrenceAccording to Forest Rangers Division wildfire occurrence data from 1993-2017 (PDF), wildfires in New York State are caused by the following.95% by humans.Lightning is responsible for 5%.Debris burning accounts for 33%.Incendiary fires account for 16%.Campfires cause 16%.Children are responsible for 4%.Smoking, equipment, railroads, and miscellaneous causes contribute to the remaining 25% of wildfires.Beginning in 2010, New York enacted revised open burning regulations that ban brush burning statewide from March 15 through May 15, a period when 47% of all fire department-response wildfires occur. Forest ranger data indicates that this new statewide ban resulted in 46% fewer spring wildfires caused by debris burning in upstate New York from 2010-2017 when compared to the previous 8-year average. Debris burning has been prohibited in New York City and Long Island for more than 40 years.\n\nWildland Fire Management in New YorkNew York state is 30.9 million acres in size with 18.9 million acres of non-federal forested lands.

We’ve seen lower rainfall and lower river levels and water tables—conditions that made it more likely that fires could escape their intended boundaries and burn into standing Amazon rainforest.”\nIt is possible to identify some understory forest fires with the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) sensors on the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites, but it’s challenging for satellites to detect all of them because they often burn beneath dense canopy. Sensors on Landsat 8 and 9 and the Sentinel-2 satellites offer more detailed observations than VIIRS and can sometimes detect understory fires, though they pass over the Amazon basin less frequently than VIIRS.\nThe false-color image above, captured by the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) sensor on Landsat 9, shows an example of several understory fires burning in densely forested areas south of Manaus. The use of the sensor’s observations in the shortwave infrared makes it easier to identify fires.\n“Understory fires are lose-lose: they degrade the value of forests and contribute to climate change,” added Morton. “We’ve been working as quickly as possible to get data from the SERVIR Amazon Fire Dashboard and several satellites about the location of these fires to fire brigades on the ground to support suppression efforts as quickly as possible.

A joint U.S./Japan science team is responsible for validation and calibration of the instrument and data products.\nThe broad spectral coverage and high spectral resolution of ASTER provides scientists in numerous disciplines with critical information for surface mapping and monitoring of dynamic conditions and temporal change. Example applications are monitoring glacial advances and retreats; monitoring potentially active volcanoes; identifying crop stress; determining cloud morphology and physical properties; wetlands evaluation; thermal pollution monitoring; coral reef degradation; surface temperature mapping of soils and geology; and measuring surface heat balance.\nThe U.S. science team is located at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.

Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water.Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery ONLY outdoors and away from windows.\n\nAssociated Content\nFlood Information Sheet (PDF)Protective Actions Research for FloodNational Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)Flood Safety Social Media ToolkitNational Weather Service Weather Ready Nation Spring Safety Outreach MaterialsFlood Insurance FactsSix Things to Know Before a Disaster (Video)When the Cloud Forms (Video)How to Prepare for a FloodFile A Flood Insurance ClaimYour Homeowners Insurance Does Not Cover Flood (PDF)American Red Cross\n\nLast Updated: 03/21/2024\n\nReturn to top\n\nDisasters and Emergencies\n\nMake a Plan\n\nGet Involved\n\nReady Business\n\nReady Kids\n\nResources\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nYouTube\n\nContact Ready \n\n \n\nReady.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nCareers\nContact Us\nFOIA\nGlossary\nNo FEAR Act\nPlug-Ins\nPrivacy\nReport Disaster Fraud\nWebsite Information\nDHS.gov\nUSA.gov\nInspector General\n\nThis site works best with Javascript enabled.", "title": "Floods | Ready.gov"}, {"document_id": "89c8998bbb932fff-0-2046", "source": "", "score": 8.610767, "text": "FEMA: Flood\n\n\nFEMA: Flood\n\nContact Us\nSite Map\nFrequently Asked Questions\nEspañol\n\nSearch\n\n Advanced Search\n\nHome\nDisaster Information\nPlan Ahead\nApply for Assistance\nRecover & Rebuild\nAbout Us\n\nDisaster Information\nTypes of Disasters\nFlood\n\nFlood Maps\nFlood Terms\nBefore a Flood\nDuring a Flood\nAfter a Flood\n\nFlood\n\nFloods are one of the most common hazards in the United States. Flood effects can be local, impacting a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins and multiple states.\nHowever, all floods are not alike. Some floods develop slowly, sometimes over a period of days. But flash floods can develop quickly, sometimes in just a few minutes and without any visible signs of rain. Flash floods often have a dangerous wall of roaring water that carries rocks, mud, and other debris and can sweep away most things in its path. Overland flooding occurs outside a defined river or stream, such as when a levee is breached, but still can be destructive. Flooding can also occur when a dam breaks, producing effects similar to flash floods.\nBe aware of flood hazards no matter where you live, but especially if you live in a low-lying area, near water or downstream from a dam. Even very small streams, gullies, creeks, culverts, dry streambeds, or low-lying ground that appear harmless in dry weather can flood. Every state is at risk from this hazard.\nWhat is the flood risk where I live?\nHow can I protect myself from a flood?\n\nKnow your flood terms\nWhat to do before a flood\nWhat to do during a flood\nWhat to do after a flood\n\nLast Modified: Friday, 13-Jun-2008 13:32:33 EDT\n\nFast Facts\nLearn about flood risk and flood insurance\nSignificant Flood Events\nFlood Health Risks\n\nSolutions\n\nRepair Flood Damage\nBuy Flood Insurance\n\nOnline Tools\n\nMap Service Center\n\nRelated Topics\n\nFlood Photos\nFloodplain Management\nFlood Hazard Mapping\n\nHome\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nImportant Notices\nFOIA\nNo FEAR Act Data\nUSA.gov\nDHS\n\nFEMA 500 C Street SW, Washington, D.C. 20472Disaster Assistance: (800) 621-FEMA, TTY (800) 462-7585\n\n \n\n", "title": "FEMA: Flood"}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "I do not have the answer to your question.", "metadata": {"author_type": "model", "author_id": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01", "created_at": 1723128860}}], "predictions": [{"text": "I'm sorry, but I don't have the answer to your question."}]}

Get flood coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).\n\nPreparing for a FloodMake a plan for your household, including your pets, so that you and your family know what to do, where to go, and what you will need to protect yourselves from flooding. Learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response.

At school, children may hear inaccurate information from peers. They may display a wide range of reactions—sadness, generalized fear, or specific fears of the disaster happening again, guilt over action or inaction during the disaster, anger that the event was not prevented, or fantasies of playing rescuer.\nPre-adolescence to adolescence - 11 through 18 years. As children grow older, they develop a more sophisticated understanding of the disaster event. Their responses are more similar to adults. Teenagers may become involved in dangerous, risk-taking behaviors, such as reckless driving, or alcohol or drug use. Others can become fearful of leaving home and avoid previous levels of activities. Much of adolescence is focused on moving out into the world. After a trauma, the view of the world can seem more dangerous and unsafe. A teenager may feel overwhelmed by intense emotions and yet feel unable to discuss them with others.\nBack To Top\n\nMeeting the Child’s Emotional Needs\nChildren’s reactions are influenced by the behavior, thoughts, and feelings of adults. Adults should encourage children and adolescents to share their thoughts and feelings about the incident. Clarify misunderstandings about risk and danger by listening to children’s concerns and answering questions. Maintain a sense of calm by validating children’s concerns and perceptions and with discussion of concrete plans for safety.\nListen to what the child is saying. If a young child is asking questions about the event, answer them simply without the elaboration needed for an older child or adult. Some children are comforted by knowing more or less information than others; decide what level of information your particular child needs. If a child has difficulty expressing feelings, allow the child to draw a picture or tell a story of what happened.\nTry to understand what is causing anxieties and fears. Be aware that following a disaster, children are most afraid that:\n\nThe event will happen again.\nSomeone close to them will be killed or injured.\nThey will be left alone or separated from the family.\n\nBack To Top\n\nReassuring Children After a Disaster\nSuggestions to help reassure children include the following:\n\nPersonal contact is reassuring.", "title": "FEMA: Helping Children Cope with Disaster"}, {"document_id": "e24601ea68d43eae-1565-3874", "source": "", "score": 8.986131, "text": "FEMA: Helping Children Cope with Disaster\nWho is at Risk?\nFor many children, reactions to disasters are brief and represent normal reactions to \"abnormal events.\" A smaller number of children can be at risk for more enduring psychological distress as a function of three major risk factors:\n\nDirect exposure to the disaster, such as being evacuated, observing injuries or death of others, or experiencing injury along with fearing one’s life is in danger.\nLoss/grief: This relates to the death or serious injury of family or friends.\nOn-going stress from the secondary effects of disaster, such as temporarily living elsewhere, loss of friends and social networks, loss of personal property, parental unemployment, and costs incurred during recovery to return the family to pre-disaster life and living conditions.\n\nBack To Top\n\nWhat Creates Vulnerabilities in Children?\nIn most cases, depending on the risk factors above, distressing responses are temporary. In the absence of severe threat to life, injury, loss of loved ones, or secondary problems such as loss of home, moves, etc., symptoms usually diminish over time. For those that were directly exposed to the disaster, reminders of the disaster such as high winds, smoke, cloudy skies, sirens, or other reminders of the disaster may cause upsetting feelings to return. Having a prior history of some type of traumatic event or severe stress may contribute to these feelings.\nChildren’s coping with disaster or emergencies is often tied to the way parents cope. They can detect adults’ fears and sadness. Parents and adults can make disasters less traumatic for children by taking steps to manage their own feelings and plans for coping. Parents are almost always the best source of support for children in disasters. One way to establish a sense of control and to build confidence in children before a disaster is to engage and involve them in preparing a family disaster plan. After a disaster, children can contribute to a family recovery plan.\nBack To Top\n\nA Child’s Reaction to Disaster by Age\nBelow are common reactions in children after a disaster or traumatic event.\nBirth through 2 years.

While the term \"global warming\" refers to the long-term warming of the planet from excess GHG emissions, the term \"climate change\" refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to the earth, including sea level rise, shrinking glaciers, ocean acidification, desertification, more intense storm activities, and shifts in plant blooming times. Increased warming of the Earth's oceans and the atmosphere is driving climate change by affecting the way heat and moisture are moved through the climate system by air and ocean currents, changing patterns of precipitation, temperatures, storms, and even sea level all around the globe.Ocean WarmingOceans cover 70% of the Earth's surface and can absorb large amounts of solar energy. Heat and moisture are moved by ocean currents and atmospheric circulation, influencing the climate around the planet.The oceans have a large capacity for absorbing and holding heat. For decades, the oceans have taken up more than 90% of excess heat from the atmosphere. If not for the ability of Earth's oceans to absorb such large amounts of heat, the atmosphere would warm at a much faster rate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 6th Assessment Report (AR6) finds that the rate of ocean warming observed since 1971 will at least double by the year 2100, even if GHG emissions are reduced. Ocean temperature plays an important role in the Earth's climate system, particularly sea surface temperature (SST). SST has risen as oceans absorb more heat from the atmosphere, resulting in changes to ocean currents and circulation, as well as sea level rise. SST has a significant impact on climate. As SST rises, increased evaporation leads to a greater concentration of water vapor over the oceans, influencing weather systems that produce precipitation or contribute to drought conditions.", "title": "Climate Change - NYSDEC"}, {"document_id": "5306392549c81595-11843-14136", "source": "", "score": 9.022875, "text": "Global Warming\nAfter that point, the decadal trend in global surface warming cannot be explained without including the contribution of the greenhouse gases added by humans.\nThough people have had the largest impact on our climate since 1950, natural changes to Earth’s climate have also occurred in recent times. For example, two major volcanic eruptions, El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991, pumped sulfur dioxide gas high into the atmosphere. The gas was converted into tiny particles that lingered for more than a year, reflecting sunlight and shading Earth’s surface. Temperatures across the globe dipped for two to three years.\n\nAlthough Earth’s temperature fluctuates naturally, human influence on climate has eclipsed the magnitude of natural temperature changes over the past 120 years. Natural influences on temperature—El Niño, solar variability, and volcanic aerosols—have varied approximately plus and minus 0.2° C (0.4° F), (averaging to about zero), while human influences have contributed roughly 0.8° C (1° F) of warming since 1889. (Graphs adapted from Lean et al., 2008.)\n\nAlthough volcanoes are active around the world, and continue to emit carbon dioxide as they did in the past, the amount of carbon dioxide they release is extremely small compared to human emissions. On average, volcanoes emit between 130 and 230 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. By burning fossil fuels, people release in excess of 100 times more, about 26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere every year (as of 2005). As a result, human activity overshadows any contribution volcanoes may have made to recent global warming.\nChanges in the brightness of the Sun can influence the climate from decade to decade, but an increase in solar output falls short as an explanation for recent warming. NASA satellites have been measuring the Sun’s output since 1978. The total energy the Sun radiates varies over an 11-year cycle. During solar maxima, solar energy is approximately 0.1 percent higher on average than it is during solar minima.\n\nThe transparent halo known as the solar corona changes between solar maximum (left) and solar minimum (right).

Climate is influenced by the movement of heat and moisture by air and ocean currents, which can affect the temperatures, precipitation, humidity, soil moisture, surface water levels, groundwater levels, and even storm events of a particular region.Climate change refers to long-term changes in the average weather patterns that define the Earth's global, regional and local climates. Often when we think of climate change, we think of the physical effects of climate change such as heatwaves, sea level rise, and heavy rainfall, and the impacts on communities and the environment, such as floods and droughts.Some climate change is influenced by naturally occurring changes in the Earth's temperature. For at least the last million years, the Earth has experienced natural cycles of cooling and warming, taking the Earth into ice ages and warming it up again. Each of these naturally-occurring cycles has taken approximately 100,000 years to complete.However, today's climate is changing much more rapidly because of greenhouse gas emissions released from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, wetland loss, and other human activities that are causing the Earth's average temperature to heat up much faster than it would naturally.The Greenhouse Effect, Greenhouse Gases, and Global Warming\n\n \n\nEnergy from the sun, or solar radiation, travels through space and enters the Earth's atmosphere, which forms a kind of warm blanket around the Earth. Some solar radiation remains trapped in the atmosphere under this blanket and is absorbed by land, air, and surface waters, while some solar radiation is reflected by land, ice, or clouds and escapes back out into space. When the Earth reflects the same amount of energy as it absorbs, the balance keeps the planet's average temperature fairly stable. This is called the greenhouse effect, and is essential for sustaining life on Earth. The revolution of the Earth around the sun and the tilt of the Earth on its axis create variation in the intensity of solar radiation received by different sections of the planet and drive naturally occurring cycles of planetary cooling and warming. This variation over time is what sends the Earth into ice ages and then into shorter warming periods between these ice ages.", "title": "Climate Change - NYSDEC", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "28f6abec5bb810ba-10637-13093", "source": "", "score": 8.9058695, "text": "Climate Change - NYSDEC\nOcean temperature plays an important role in the Earth's climate system, particularly sea surface temperature (SST).

As SST rises, increased evaporation leads to a greater concentration of water vapor over the oceans, influencing weather systems that produce precipitation or contribute to drought conditions. Heat from water at the ocean's surface provides tropical storms and hurricanes with energy and influences weather patterns.The U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports that over the last two decades the Atlantic Ocean along the northeastern United States (U.S.) has warmed faster than 99% of the global ocean. Coastal temperatures along the northeastern U.S. increased by 0.06°F per year from 1982 to 2016. Ocean temperatures over the Northeastern continental shelf are expected to warm by up to 0.76°F per decade by 2070.Ocean circulation plays an important role in climate through the movement of heat, freshwater, nutrients, and carbon. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) moves warm water from the tropics poleward and cold water from the poles towards the equator, largely influencing the climates of North America and Europe. However, warming ocean temperatures and changes in ocean salinity due to an influx of freshwater from melting sea ice and glaciers, can slow down the AMOC. The amount and velocity of heat transported by AMOC can be a cause for extreme weather and changes to precipitation patterns experienced by these continents.Increasing ocean temperatures can also create disturbances to marine ecosystems and the loss of essential habitats for marine fish and mammals. The loss of coral reef habitat from coral bleaching is a result of warming ocean temperatures. Pathogens, such as harmful algal blooms and bacteria, can spread more easily in warmer waters, putting global water supplies, human and animal health, and economies that depend on the fishing industry, at risk.Ocean AcidificationHigh levels of GHGs in the atmosphere are not only increasing global warming and intensifying climate change but are also threatening the health of ocean life and ecosystems.

Rain and snowmelt comes down from the San Gabriel Mountains through a series of dams and are then diverted to \"spreading basins\". Spreading basins are designated areas of land that are very permeable, such as sand and gravel areas.

Stormwater pollution comes from numerous sources, but many can be reduced or eliminated through small actions taken around your home, yard and business.\nMaking small changes such as using organic pesticides and fertilizers, keeping your vehicle clean and maintained, picking up after your pet, ensuring trash is properly disposed of, securing items in your truck-bed can truly reduce stormwater pollution where you live.\n\nStormwater Links\n\nAbout Stormwater\nPollutants\nResources\nGet Involved\nOur Partners\n\nHere’s a few tips to get you started:\n\n1.\n\nProperly Dispose Of Trash And Litter\nDispose trash and recycling items in a waste or recycling receptacle. If it’s left lying around, it can blow away or fall to the ground and end up in stormwater. Common trash and litter pollutants include:\n\nFood wrappers or packaging\nPlastic containers\nCigarette butts\nSingle-use items\nFace masks or gloves\n\n2.\n\nClean Out Your Vehicle And Truck Beds\nTrash, recyclables and other debris can fall out of an open window or truck bed. Keep a small litter bag in your car, and put items in the garbage can when you get home or visit a gas station. These are some of the common items that can fly out of a vehicle in motion:\n\nFood wrappers or packaging\nEmpty beverage containers\nPlastic containers\nRecreational items\nLandscape waste\n\n3.\n\nSecure Your Load\nMake sure items in your truck bed are secured with tarps and tie-downs or a cargo net.

It’s also from snow and ice melt that drips off roofs, cars and vegetation, and then runs onto driveways, walkways and roads. Another source is from irrigation and over watering of vegetation that runs into streets.\nThis excess water flows into the storm drain inlets built into our roadways. Stormwater systems were originally intended to route rainwater quickly off the streets during a heavy storm. Drains carry water through a system of pipes, emptying into the nearest body of water.\nHere are ways you can help prevent stormwater pollution:\n\nPlan ahead when traveling with pets, their waste needs to be properly disposed.\nKeep your tires properly inflated to prevent wear and tear and reduce heavy metal pollution. Plus, you’ll get better gas mileage.\nRegularly maintain vehicles to prevent auto fluid leaks from dripping onto roadways.\nWipe down tire wheel wells to remove brake dust. Copper metals found in brakes are a major pollutant.\nKeep your vehicle clean and use a car wash facility that recycles their water.\nChoose to use non-toxic products in your home’s outdoor spaces, and never apply them before wind or rain are in the forecast.\nProperly dispose of trash and recycling. This includes cigarette butts, which are the number one littered item.\nAlways secure vehicle loads to reduce debris and roadway hazards.\n\nWhy does stormwater matter?", "title": "About Stormwater | Caltrans"}, {"document_id": "5ed8d5fe6c497e3d-9783-11678", "source": "", "score": 7.345447, "text": "Reporting Dead Wildlife - NYSDEC\nArea should be inaccessible to children or domestic animals.You can have a NWCO (Nuisance Wildlife Control Operator) Licensed Company come out for a fee and remove the wildlife for you.Disinfection ProceduresIn case of exposure or contamination:Skin: Wash skin thoroughly with hot water and soap.

Average use per person is 100-110 gallons per day.\t\n\n5.\nWhat is ground water?\n\r\nContrary to what a lot of people think, groundwater is not found in underground rivers or lakes. Rather, it is water that fills the cracks and pore spaces in rocks and sediments that lie beneath the surface of the earth, much the way water fills the open spaces and saturates a sponge or towel. \t\n\n6.\nWhy is keeping our groundwater clean so important?\n\r\nThe San Gabriel Valley is unique in that it is one of the few natural underground reservoirs in the United States. Rain and snowmelt comes down from the San Gabriel Mountains through a series of dams and are then diverted to \"spreading basins\". Spreading basins are designated areas of land that are very permeable, such as sand and gravel areas. Water can then percolate into the ground. 100% of the water served to residents and businesses in Monterey Park comes from groundwater. Thus, keeping our groundwater resource clean is vitally important to all of us. \t\n\n7.\nWhere do groundwater toxins come from?\n\r\nMany products we use around our homes everyday are considered toxic, such as household cleaners, flea powders, garden pesticides, paints, varnishes, motor oil, and antifreeze. These products are not only hazardous to our health, but to our environment. By disposing these harmful products improperly, we are contributing to the groundwater contamination in the San Gabriel Valley.\t\n\n8.\nCan contaminated groundwater be cleaned up?\n\r\nYes, but it can be time-consuming and expensive. Communities whose drinking water source has become contaminated have had to spend millions of dollars to remove contaminants from the water before it can be piped to homes and businesses. The cleanup is effective, but it can significantly affect the cost of providing the water to customers.", "title": "FAQs • Where do groundwater toxins come from?", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "b4521304b77788b6-4612-6743", "source": "", "score": 11.446406, "text": "FAQs • Where do groundwater toxins come from?\nBy disposing these harmful products improperly, we are contributing to the groundwater contamination in the San Gabriel Valley.\t\n\n8.\nCan contaminated groundwater be cleaned up?\n\r\nYes, but it can be time-consuming and expensive.

It is far better to prevent contamination in the first place. What are the dos and do nots for groundwater?Do: Purchase only what you need Use products completely before disposing Recycle whatever you can (oil, batteries, etc.) Recycle surplus paintsDo not: Dump products onto the ground (they can contaminate soil and groundwater) Pour products or wastes into the street (they can contaminate oceans, lakes, and groundwater) Put hazardous or toxic products in the trash Pour products down the drainView proper disposal of Household Hazardous Wastes online. \n\n9.\nIs our water fluoridated?\n\r\nAt this time fluoride is not added to the water. There are low levels of fluoride naturally occurring in the water. The range at which they occur is between 0.2 to 0.8 milligrams per liter (mg/L). The optimum fluoride level recommended to reduce dental caries (cavities) is a consistent .8 mg/L does. A bill signed by Governor Wilson in 1997 mandates drinking water fluoridation for larger water utilities, including Monterey Park, and requires the state to provide funding for the installation and operation of fluoridation equipment. The state is currently seeking funding for this program.\t\n\n10.\nDoes the City of Monterey Park own the Garvey Reservoir?\n\r\nThe Garvey Reservoir is not owned by the City of Monterey Park and the water it contains is not stored for city use.\t\n\nLive Edit\n\n \n\n \n\nCoronavirus Updates\n\nAgenda Center\n\nDocuments Prior to 2012\n\nTeleconference Procedures\n\nCity Council Meetings Written Communications / Addendums\n\nWritten Communications / Addendums 2024\n\nWritten Communications / Addendums 2023", "title": "FAQs • Where do groundwater toxins come from?"}, {"document_id": "b4521304b77788b6-2-2025", "source": "", "score": 11.109868, "text": "FAQs • Where do groundwater toxins come from?\nFAQs • Where do groundwater toxins come from?\n\n \n\nSkip to Main Content\n\nCreate a Website Account - Manage notification subscriptions, save form progress and more.   \n\nWebsite Sign In\n\n \n\n 中文 Español\n\n \n \n \n\nGovernmentServicesResidentsVisitorsBusinessHow Do I...\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nSearch\n\n \n \n \n\n \nHomeFAQs\n\nSearch\n\nAll categories\nCode Enforcement\nConstruction Inspections\nDrone FAQs\nElection Information (English)\nFire Department\nLibrary\nMulti-Family Residential/Apartment Inspection Program\nPlanning\nPublic Works - Slurry Seal\nWater\n\nCategories\n\nAll Categories\n\nCode Enforcement\n\nConstruction Inspections\n\nDrone FAQs\n\nElection Information (English)\n\nFire Department\n\nLibrary\n\nMulti-Family Residential/Apartment Inspection Program\n\nPlanning\n\nPublic Works - Slurry Seal\n\nWater\n\n \n\r\nWhere do groundwater toxins come from?\t\n\r\nMany products we use around our homes everyday are considered toxic, such as household cleaners, flea powders, garden pesticides, paints, varnishes, motor oil, and antifreeze.

A TMDL is developed for each pollutant contributing to the impairment of a listed water body. The development of a TMDL involves the following\r\nsteps:\n\nDetermination of how much of a particular pollutant a water body can receive from all sources and still meet water quality standards. \nDetermination of how much of the existing level of pollution must be reduced to meet water quality standards. \nAllocation of responsibility for reducing pollution to the acceptable level among the various contributing sources, including both point and nonpoint sources.\nDevelopment of a plan to implement the TMDL. While implementation plans are not currently a federal requirement, federal regulations effective later this\r\nyear will require these plans. \nAdoption of a regulation (a \"basin plan amendment\") to establish actions to implement a TMDL, such as revising permits to control waste discharges. \n\nWhen a listed water body later meets water quality standards, it is \"de-listed.\" Neither state nor federal law specifies a time schedule for the development or\r\nimplementation of TMDLs or for when listed water bodies should become de-listed. Only three of the 18 impaired water bodies on the state's initial list from\r\n1976 have been de-listed.\nState Versus Federal Role. The state is primarily responsible for compiling the list of impaired water bodies and developing TMDLs.

Reduce water pollution by sweeping your driveway instead of using the hose and, if you can, by washing your car at a facility. The United States Environmental Protection Agency warns that washing cars and driveways at home can cause pollution as metals and fluids are washed off and enter storm drains, collecting more pollutants along the way and ending up in our waterways. If you can, choose car wash facilities that use advanced filtration systems to recycle water used for washing cars.\nGo organic. This summer consider using natural pest control methods instead of harmful pesticides. Pesticides made from highly toxic chemicals can have long-lasting effects on the health of our water and the environment. By choosing organic alternatives, like companion planting or using beneficial insects like ladybugs, you can make a difference.\nGive your vehicle a tune-up.

(It can’t orbit Europa because doing so would bring Europa Clipper too close to the gas giant’s brutal radiation belts. Learn more in the video.) On each flyby, a suite of science instruments will gather data on how deep the subsurface ocean is, how thick the ice crust is, and, potentially, the characteristics of any plumes that may be venting subsurface water into space. The goal is to find out whether Europa has the potential to support life.\nThe series’ premiere episode features Europa Clipper Project Manager Jordan Evans, who also has worked on NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover and the agency’s Hubble Space Telescope. In the video, he joins Deputy Science Manager Trina Ray, who worked on NASA’s Cassini and Galileo missions. They venture into JPL’s storied High Bay 1 clean room, where the Europa Clipper spacecraft is under construction – and where all of NASA’s Mars rovers, the twin Voyager spacecraft, and other historic spacecraft were assembled.\nWhile you’re digging into the nuts and bolts of the spacecraft, check out a 24-hour live feed of assembly in progress in High Bay 1.\nAdditional episodes of “Spacecraft Makers” will include more activity inside other clean rooms where components of Europa Clipper are coming together.

Landing on Mars is notoriously difficult. But Mars offers a more tolerable environment than Venus for any plucky probes that reach the Martian surface intact. Generations of rovers and landers have taught us much about the Red Planet. A few billion years ago, an ocean may have covered one-fifth of the Martian surface. Indeed, scientists think Mars was once habitable. Then, over millions of years, Mars lost most of the water that was on its surface. Solar wind and radiation stripped away the Martian atmosphere. An ocean world that could have supported life is now a frigid, nearly airless desert.\nBut more exotic worlds farther from the Sun host vast oceans in the present day. Europa is one of those worlds.\nIt Matters Where We Find Life\nAround most stars is a region where conditions are just right for an orbiting planet to have liquid water on its surface. That region is the star’s habitable zone or \"Goldilocks zone.” But scientists have learned that worlds outside the Goldilocks zone can have liquid oceans as well, including several moons in our outer solar system.\nSome moons of Saturn and Jupiter (including Europa, we suspect) are ocean worlds – they have oceans beneath their icy surfaces. In fact, finding life in one of these oceans might be more consequential than finding life on Mars. It could change how humans understand the equation for life in the cosmos.\n\nIn theory, even simple lifeforms can travel from one planet to another. A meteorite collides with a planet and ejects surface material containing microbes. The rocky chunks float through space until some collide with another planet. Life then springs forth on a new world.\nIf life existed on Earth and Mars, it didn’t necessarily start on both worlds. Instead, life may have evolved on one of the two planets, then traveled to the other. We know the two planets swap rocks because Mars rocks have been found on Earth.\nThe outer solar system is another story.", "title": "Europa: A World of Ice, With Potential for Life – NASA's Europa Clipper"}, {"document_id": "0a437f6bacf55ac9-2-1972", "source": "", "score": 10.638534, "text": "Europa: A World of Ice, With Potential for Life – NASA's Europa Clipper\nEuropa: A World of Ice, With Potential for Life – NASA's Europa Clipper\n\nNASA\n\nEuropa Clipper\n\nSkip Navigation\n\nmenu\n\nclose modal\n\nNews\n\n| June 8, 2021\n\nEuropa: A World of Ice, With Potential for Life\n\nJupiter’s icy moon Europa may be the most promising place in the solar system to find present-day environments suitable for life beyond Earth.\nScientists study the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe in a scientific field called astrobiology. They’ve found that life as we know it requires three main ingredients: temperatures that allow liquid water to exist; the presence of carbon-based molecules; and an energy input, such as sunlight.\nEuropa seems to have all three ingredients. But to understand why it’s a uniquely captivating target for astrobiology, it helps to know a bit about a few other moons and planets in the solar system. The story starts with water.\nProbing Planets’ Pasts\nAlmost everywhere we find water on Earth, we also find life. So water’s presence or absence is an initial way to assess a world’s habitability. As it happens, Earth’s planetary neighbors may have once been wetter.\nFor as long as 2 billion years, liquid water may have covered much of the surface of Venus. But today Venus is a hellscape. The planet’s atmospheric pressure would crush a human, and temperatures reach 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius). Even if evidence for life were sitting on the planet’s surface, searching for it would be challenging. The planet’s climate is nearly as damaging to robotic probes as it would be to humans.\n\nMars is more merciful. Landing on Mars is notoriously difficult.

The Europa Clipper orbiter will swoop around Jupiter on an elliptical path, dipping close to the moon on each flyby to collect data. Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nNASA has selected Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) of Hawthorne, California, to provide launch services for Earth’s first mission to conduct detailed investigations of Jupiter's moon Europa.\nThe Europa Clipper mission will launch in October 2024 on a Falcon Heavy rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The total contract award amount for launch services is approximately $178 million.\nEuropa Clipper will conduct a detailed survey of Europa and use a sophisticated suite of science instruments to investigate whether the icy moon has conditions suitable for life. Key mission objectives are to produce high-resolution images of Europa's surface, determine its composition, look for signs of recent or ongoing geological activity, measure the thickness of the moon’s icy shell, search for subsurface lakes, and determine the depth and salinity of Europa's ocean.\nNASA’s Launch Services Program at Kennedy will manage the Europa Clipper launch service.

Like Bray, she began her work on the antenna in 2014. The radio frequency module includes the spacecraft’s entire telecommunications subsystem and a total of seven antennas, the high-gain among them. Her job during installation was to ensure the antenna was properly mounted to the spacecraft and that the components are correctly oriented and well integrated.\nWhile the engineers at both APL and JPL have practiced the installation many times, virtually and with real-world mock-ups, Aug. 14 was the first time the high-gain antenna was attached to the spacecraft.\n“I’ve never worked on anything of this magnitude, in terms of physical size and also in terms of just general interest,” she said. “Little kids know where Jupiter is.

The spacecraft will orbit Jupiter and make nearly 50 flybys of Europa to determine whether there are places below Europa’s surface that could support life.\nWith its solar arrays deployed, Europa Clipper spans more than 100 feet (about 30 meters) – about the length of a basketball court. The main body of the spacecraft consists of its avionics vault, radiofrequency module, and propulsion module. \r\nAt launch, Europa Clipper will weigh approximately 13,000 pounds (6,000 kilograms). Almost half of the weight will be fuel – nearly 6,000 pounds (2,750 kilograms) of propellant. \nEuropa Clipper will launch in October 2024 on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The spacecraft will fly by Mars, then back by Earth, using the gravity of each planet to increase its momentum. These so-called “gravity assists” will provide Europa Clipper with the velocity needed to reach Jupiter in 2030.\nAfter it begins orbiting Jupiter, Europa Clipper will spend about a year altering its trajectory to prepare for its first Europa flyby. The spacecraft will then spend about three years soaring past Europa dozens of times and sending data back to Earth. Over the course of the mission, the spacecraft will investigate nearly the entire moon.\nFast Facts\nEuropa Clipper Fast Facts\n\nWith its solar arrays deployed, Europa Clipper spans more than 100 feet (about 30 meters) – about the length of a basketball court.\nThe spacecraft has 24 engines.", "title": "Meet Europa Clipper | Spacecraft – NASA's Europa Clipper"}, {"document_id": "15a9b4e99e304cb1-2-2227", "source": "", "score": 16.98972, "text": "NASA Mission Named 'Europa Clipper' – NASA's Europa Clipper\nNASA Mission Named 'Europa Clipper' – NASA's Europa Clipper\n\nNASA\n\nEuropa Clipper\n\nSkip Navigation\n\nmenu\n\nclose modal\n\nNews\n\n| March 9, 2017\n\nNASA Mission Named 'Europa Clipper'\n\nNASA's Europa Clipper mission is being designed to fly by the icy Jovian moon multiple times and investigate whether it possesses the ingredients necessary for life.\nCredits: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SETI Institute\n\nNASA's upcoming mission to investigate the habitability of Jupiter's icy moon Europa now has a formal name: Europa Clipper.\nThe moniker harkens back to the clipper ships that sailed across the oceans of Earth in the 19th century.

His team created a variety of candidate science tours for the mission.

If you have a lawyer, then the lawyer will present your oral argument. You can go to court for oral argument but you are not required to go if you are represented by a lawyer.\n \n Can I get a transcript of what was said in the oral argument for my case? All oral arguments in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee to get a copy of the oral argument recording from the Court of Appeal. If you want a written transcript of the recording, you will need to contact a transcription service and pay them a separate fee.\n \n What does the court think if I do not make an oral argument? If you decide not to make an oral argument, the court will not think that you are not interested or that you don’t care about the appeal. You do not give up or weaken any arguments in your brief. The court will not think differently or badly about you or your arguments. If you do not make an oral argument, it will not negatively impact the way the court decides an appeal.\n \n How will the court decide if there are no oral arguments? If all the parties waive oral argument – meaning no parties talk to the justices in person – then the Court of Appeal will decide your appeal based on the briefs, the law, and the record on appeal.\n \n What does it mean if the court sends me a notice saying they don’t need oral argument? Sometimes the Court of Appeal will send notice to the parties saying the court is prepared to issue a decision without oral argument. This is not a sign that the court will decide either for or against the appeal.\nEven though the court says oral argument is not necessary, you can still request oral argument.

When there is no oral argument, the Court of Appeal justices decide an appeal based on the briefs and the record on appeal.\n\nOral argument does not slow down or speed up the appeal process.

The legal fees will be subtracted from the retainer. If the retainer starts to run out, you may need to add more money.\n\nContingency fee\nYou pay the lawyer from the money you receive if you win the case or settle it out of court. If you lose, the lawyer does not receive a fee.\n\nStatutory fee\nThe cost is set by law\n\nThe lawyer will also charge you for the costs of your case (filing fees, copying expenses, expert fees). You will be responsible for paying these costs even if your case is not successful. Costs can add up quickly. It is a good idea to ask the lawyer for a written estimate of what the costs will be.\n\n Handling problems with a lawyer\n\n If you have questions or concerns about your case, first talk to your lawyer. If you are having serious problems with your lawyer and have been unable to resolve them, there are other things you can do.\nThe State Bar also has a lot of information about what to do if you are having problems with your lawyer.\n\n \n\nWas this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\ndid this information help you with your case?\n\nGreat!", "title": "Hire a lawyer | California Courts | Self Help Guide", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "fb227e01016a7dc9-6288-7350", "source": "", "score": 13.559496, "text": "Hire a lawyer | California Courts | Self Help Guide\nHandling problems with a lawyer\n\n If you have questions or concerns about your case, first talk to your lawyer. If you are having serious problems with your lawyer and have been unable to resolve them, there are other things you can do.\nThe State Bar also has a lot of information about what to do if you are having problems with your lawyer.\n\n \n\nWas this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\ndid this information help you with your case?\n\nGreat!

For example, to see if the trial court judge applied the wrong law to the facts of the case.\nThe appellate court cannot change the trial court's decision just because the appellate court judges (called justices in the Court of Appeal) disagree with it\nThe trial court is entitled to hear the evidence and come to its own decision. The appellate court can only reverse the trial court's decision if it finds a legal mistake in the trial court proceedings that was so important that it changed at least part of the outcome of the case. Because of this heavy burden on the appellant to prove this type of mistake, it is quite difficult to win an appeal.\nFiling an appeal does not stop the trial court's order\nUnless you ask the trial or appellate court to postpone (\"stay\") the trial court's order, you must do what the trial court's order requires you to do during the appeal. A request for a stay can be complicated, and you may still have to pay some of the money ordered by the trial court upfront. Ask a lawyer if one of these options would be good in your case and get help.

This is the case with Chapter 861 of 2023 (SB 71, Umberg),\r\nwhich increases the small claims case threshold from $10,000 to $12,500\r\nand the limited civil threshold from $25,000 to $35,000. These changes\r\ncould impact the number of people seeking self-help assistance as\r\nindividuals are required to represent themselves in small claims\r\nproceedings and may be more likely to do so in limited civil cases as\r\nwell. These changes could also reduce the amount of civil filing fee\r\nrevenue available to support county law libraries as there may be fewer\r\nrelevant fees that will be charged. Both of these changes could increase\r\nthe unmet need for legal resources.\nStrategic Plan for Funding Could Improve Service\r\nLevels. Given that a significant number of people can\r\nbenefit from legal assistance and services, it is important that the\r\nstate maximizes effective use of funding for these legal resources.\r\nMaximizing effective use includes strategically determining where money\r\nshould be placed to achieve the greatest legislatively desired results,\r\nto provide people with the resources they most need, and to provide\r\nservice in the most cost-effective ways possible.

ISRU is another acronym, In Situ Resource Utilization, which is a technical way of describing what most of us call \"living off the land.\"\nThe word \"moxie,\" used to describe someone with spunk and audacity, came from the soft drink of the same name. The soft drink, Moxie, was invented in the late 1800s in Lowell, Massachusetts, not far from the M.I.T. Haystack Observatory where the MOXIE principal investigator works. You can still buy Moxie in New England, and it's considered the official drink of the state of Maine.\nThe connection with soft drinks doesn't end there. According to some accounts, the Moxie company was the first in the U.S. to use carbon dioxide (CO2) to make a beverage fizzy. On Mars, MOXIE is the first to use carbon dioxide to make – well, anything at all. Another connection is more technical. Whenever we run MOXIE, we need to be very careful with the settings to make sure we only produce carbon monoxide (CO), and not pure carbon, which would ruin it. That destructive process is called \"coking.\" The carbon deposit itself is called – coke.\n\nAll About MOXIE\n\nWhat does MOXIE do?\n\nCompared to what we're used to on Earth, the air on Mars is very thin. In fact, there is less than 1% as much air on the surface of Mars as on Earth, and visiting Mars would be like flying in a balloon 100,00 feet up in the air.", "title": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars"}, {"document_id": "eb89f1b8e630dca6-1227-3016", "source": "", "score": 9.940954, "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nThe Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment, or MOXIE, is helping NASA prepare for human exploration of Mars.

In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product. The most common example is the hydrogen fuel cell, used in some automobiles, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity. A hydrogen cell of this type, in contrast, would start with the water and use electricity to turn it back into hydrogen and oxygen. The two devices, the fuel cell and the electrolyzer, are nearly identical devices, operated in a very different way.\nUsing water to make oxygen on Mars would be a great idea if we had easy access to the water. But to get water, we would have to travel to the far north or south to find ice, or to mine for ice buried deep in the ground. Fortunately, though, another source of oxygen is all around us, in the form of the carbon dioxide that makes up most of the Martian air. So instead of using hydrogen, MOXIE is an example of a solid oxide electrolyzer cell that uses carbon dioxide to make the gasses carbon monoxide and oxygen. \n\nWhy will we need oxygen on Mars?\n\nThe first human crew to go to Mars will need a lot of oxygen to breathe, as much as 2 to 3 tons. Our bodies use that oxygen to burn our fuel, which we call \"food,\" in order to make the energy that keeps us going all day. But it's not just humans who need oxygen. Nearly everything that uses fuel to make energy uses oxygen to burn that fuel, whether it's a car, a campfire, or a rocket. And it turns out that the oxygen, which on Earth we get for free from the air, actually weighs a lot more than the fuel itself.\nWhen we send the first crew to Mars, we would need to think about how to bring them home at the end of their visit. And the single biggest user of oxygen in their entire stay on Mars will be the rocket that takes them back to orbit.", "title": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "eb89f1b8e630dca6-5670-7525", "source": "", "score": 21.338737, "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nThat destructive process is called \"coking.\" The carbon deposit itself is called – coke.\n\nAll About MOXIE\n\nWhat does MOXIE do?\n\nCompared to what we're used to on Earth, the air on Mars is very thin. In fact, there is less than 1% as much air on the surface of Mars as on Earth, and visiting Mars would be like flying in a balloon 100,00 feet up in the air. And not only is the air thin, but it's made almost entirely out of carbon dioxide (CO2).\nOn Earth, we can thank the myriad forms of life for the oxygen in our atmosphere that our body greedily absorbs with every breath we take. All around us, trees and plants are busy scrubbing CO2 out of our atmosphere and turning it into useful oxygen, at the same time taking up water and turning it into the chemicals that the plants need to live. Mars isn't so fortunate, so if we want oxygen on Mars we'll have to make it ourselves. That's what MOXIE does.\n\nWhat is ISRU?\n\nThe \"I\" in MOXIE stands for ISRU, or In Situ Resource Utilization. \"In Situ\" refers to the stuff that's there – on Mars in this case. Resource Utilization means using that stuff for some productive purpose, usually to make something that we would otherwise have to bring with us. In other words, living off the land (LOL). Maybe LOL would have been a better acronym than ISRU, but that's already been taken! One example of ISRU might be making bricks out of Martian soil, and using the bricks for buildings.

If we want oxygen on Mars, we either have to bring it along, or make it ourselves.\n\nFuel Needs Oxygen to Burn\nOn Earth, we are always getting energy from the reaction between oxygen and whatever fuel we are using — whether it's a log in a campfire or gasoline in a car tank. The oxygen weighs several times more than the fuel it burns, which is not an issue on our planet. However, when we have to bring it with us to other locations in space, we need to think a lot about that weight and other factors.\n\nMOXIE Makes Oxygen 'Out of Thin Air'", "title": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "eb89f1b8e630dca6-11249-13070", "source": "", "score": 15.191498, "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nWhen we send an astronaut crew to Mars, one idea is to send all the things they'll need – a place to live, rovers, a power plant, and maybe a \"Big MOXIE\" – on one launch opportunity, then send the astronauts on the next opportunity, 26 months later. If we do that, then the base would be in place for about 20 months before the astronauts start their trip. The goal of a Big MOXIE would be to make and store all the oxygen that the astronaut and their rocket would need for their mission before they even launch. That means the Big MOXIE would need to make 2,000 to 3,000 grams of oxygen per hour, compared to the 6-10 grams that the current MOXIE is making. And it would need to do that all day and night, without stopping, for most of the 20 months.\nWe expect that the astronauts would need at least 25 kilowatts of power for their mission, and that the Big MOXIE relies on being able to use that power plant for making oxygen until the astronauts arrive. We also expect Big MOXIE to be the size of a small chest freezer and to weigh about 1 ton.\n\nGet the Mars Newsletter\n\nSubscribe to newsletter\n\nFollow the Mission\n\nAbout The Mission\n\nOverview\nScience\nMars Rock Samples\nMars Weather\nWhere is Perseverance?\nExplore with Perseverance\nLanding Site\nMission Team\nFAQs\n\nSpacecraft\n\nOverview\nRover\nInstruments\nRocket\n\nTimeline\n\nOverview\nPre-Launch\nLaunch\nCruise\nLanding\nSurface Operations\n\nNews\n\nNews\nNewsroom\nRover Updates\nWatch Online\n\nMultimedia\n\nImages\nRaw Images\nVideos\nAudio\nMore Resources\n\nParticipate\n\nOverview\nYou've Got Perseverance!\nRoving With Perseverance\nSend Your Name to Mars\nSounds of Mars\nMars Photo Booth\n#CountdownToMars\nName the Rover\n\nAll Mars\n\nMars Exploration Home\nMars Sample Return\nMars Science Laboratory\nMAVEN\nMars Reconnaissance Orbiter\nMars Odyssey\nInSight Mission\nMars Exploration Rovers\n\nNASA", "title": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars"}, {"document_id": "eb89f1b8e630dca6-8588-10516", "source": "", "score": 14.863011, "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nNearly everything that uses fuel to make energy uses oxygen to burn that fuel, whether it's a car, a campfire, or a rocket. And it turns out that the oxygen, which on Earth we get for free from the air, actually weighs a lot more than the fuel itself.\nWhen we send the first crew to Mars, we would need to think about how to bring them home at the end of their visit. And the single biggest user of oxygen in their entire stay on Mars will be the rocket that takes them back to orbit. While the astronauts may breathe 2 to 3 tons of oxygen in their 18-month stay on the planet, the ascent rocket would use 25 to 30 tons.\n\nHow much oxygen does MOXIE make?\n\nMOXIE was designed to make at least 6 grams of oxygen per hour. The maximum it can make is 12 grams per hour, although there isn't enough CO2 at our high-altitude Jezero crater landing site to make much more than 10. For comparison, you're probably using about 10 grams per hour while you're reading this explanation (unless you're riding your exercise bike while you're reading)!\nWhy so little? It takes a lot of power to pull apart CO2 molecules, and the Perseverance rover only provides about 100 Watts. That's not much more than the computer you're using to read this. If we're to make useful amounts of oxygen in the future, we'll need a much larger power plant.\n\nWhat does a MOXIE run look like?\n\nThe \"solid oxide\" in a solid oxide electrolyzer cell is a ceramic made mostly of zirconia that is heated to 1,472 degrees Fahrenheit (800 degrees Celsius) inside a special miniature oven. When MOXIE runs, it first has to heat up that ceramic to its operating temperature. That takes about two hours.

Plants and trees use water and sunlight to convert the carbon dioxide back to oxygen, replenishing the air. On Mars, MOXIE also makes oxygen from carbon dioxide, about as much as a modest-sized tree, though using a very different process.\n\nMOXIE is a Scale Model for a Future Big MOXIE\nTo launch from Mars, a small crew of human explorers will need 25 to 30 tons of oxygen, or about the weight of a tractor-trailer! To make that much oxygen would require a 25,000 to 30,000 watt power plant. The Perseverance power system only provides about 100 watts, so MOXIE can only make a small fraction of the oxygen that a future \"Big MOXIE\" would need to make.\n\nMOXIE is a 'Tech Demo'\nNASA uses technical demonstrations, or tech demos, when it's not enough to just test a critical technology in the laboratory and it needs to be proven on an actual mission.\n\nWhere Is MOXIE Located?\n\nMichael Hecht\nPrincipal Investigator\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology,\nCambridge, Massachusetts\n\nDid You Know?\nMOXIE uses a device called an \"electrolyzer\" to make oxygen from the carbon dioxide in the air.

That's a tall order. But more than that, we hope to learn a lot of technical details about how to build that much larger future MOXIE system.

Mars isn't so fortunate, so if we want oxygen on Mars we'll have to make it ourselves. That's what MOXIE does.\n\nWhat is ISRU?\n\nThe \"I\" in MOXIE stands for ISRU, or In Situ Resource Utilization. \"In Situ\" refers to the stuff that's there – on Mars in this case. Resource Utilization means using that stuff for some productive purpose, usually to make something that we would otherwise have to bring with us. In other words, living off the land (LOL). Maybe LOL would have been a better acronym than ISRU, but that's already been taken! One example of ISRU might be making bricks out of Martian soil, and using the bricks for buildings. Another example is making oxygen out of the thin Martian air.\n\nHow does MOXIE work?\n\nMOXIE is an example of a \"solid oxide electrolyzer cell,\" which is a fuel cell that runs in reverse.

ISRU is another acronym, In Situ Resource Utilization, which is a technical way of describing what most of us call \"living off the land.\"\nThe word \"moxie,\" used to describe someone with spunk and audacity, came from the soft drink of the same name. The soft drink, Moxie, was invented in the late 1800s in Lowell, Massachusetts, not far from the M.I.T. Haystack Observatory where the MOXIE principal investigator works. You can still buy Moxie in New England, and it's considered the official drink of the state of Maine.\nThe connection with soft drinks doesn't end there. According to some accounts, the Moxie company was the first in the U.S. to use carbon dioxide (CO2) to make a beverage fizzy. On Mars, MOXIE is the first to use carbon dioxide to make – well, anything at all. Another connection is more technical. Whenever we run MOXIE, we need to be very careful with the settings to make sure we only produce carbon monoxide (CO), and not pure carbon, which would ruin it. That destructive process is called \"coking.\" The carbon deposit itself is called – coke.\n\nAll About MOXIE\n\nWhat does MOXIE do?\n\nCompared to what we're used to on Earth, the air on Mars is very thin. In fact, there is less than 1% as much air on the surface of Mars as on Earth, and visiting Mars would be like flying in a balloon 100,00 feet up in the air.", "title": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars"}, {"document_id": "eb89f1b8e630dca6-5670-7525", "source": "", "score": 9.404235, "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nThat destructive process is called \"coking.\" The carbon deposit itself is called – coke.\n\nAll About MOXIE\n\nWhat does MOXIE do?\n\nCompared to what we're used to on Earth, the air on Mars is very thin. In fact, there is less than 1% as much air on the surface of Mars as on Earth, and visiting Mars would be like flying in a balloon 100,00 feet up in the air. And not only is the air thin, but it's made almost entirely out of carbon dioxide (CO2).\nOn Earth, we can thank the myriad forms of life for the oxygen in our atmosphere that our body greedily absorbs with every breath we take. All around us, trees and plants are busy scrubbing CO2 out of our atmosphere and turning it into useful oxygen, at the same time taking up water and turning it into the chemicals that the plants need to live. Mars isn't so fortunate, so if we want oxygen on Mars we'll have to make it ourselves. That's what MOXIE does.\n\nWhat is ISRU?\n\nThe \"I\" in MOXIE stands for ISRU, or In Situ Resource Utilization. \"In Situ\" refers to the stuff that's there – on Mars in this case. Resource Utilization means using that stuff for some productive purpose, usually to make something that we would otherwise have to bring with us. In other words, living off the land (LOL). Maybe LOL would have been a better acronym than ISRU, but that's already been taken! One example of ISRU might be making bricks out of Martian soil, and using the bricks for buildings. Another example is making oxygen out of the thin Martian air.\n\nHow does MOXIE work?\n\nMOXIE is an example of a \"solid oxide electrolyzer cell,\" which is a fuel cell that runs in reverse. In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product. The most common example is the hydrogen fuel cell, used in some automobiles, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity.", "title": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars"}, {"document_id": "bd649215f21fd67f-4133-6075", "source": "", "score": 8.7594385, "text": "The Space Place Experiment Center | NASA Space Place – NASA Science for Kids\nScientists are very interested in figuring out how much carbon dioxide plants take in across different areas because carbon dioxide causes our planet to warm. To figure this out, they need to know how much water is in the soil in different areas—a hard measurement to come by.\nNASA has come up with a solution to this problem. Two missions—AirMOSS and UAVSAR—can study soil moisture from the sky. Both AirMOSS and UAVSAR are special kinds of radar attached to a plane. Scientists can measure how much moisture is in the soil that AirMOSS or UAVSAR flies over. AirMOSS can actually measure how much moisture is in the part of the soil that the plant’s roots are in.\nUsing this information, scientists may be able to figure out just how much carbon plants take in over all of North America!\n\nA NASA plane flying with UAVSAR attached to its base.

In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product. The most common example is the hydrogen fuel cell, used in some automobiles, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity. A hydrogen cell of this type, in contrast, would start with the water and use electricity to turn it back into hydrogen and oxygen. The two devices, the fuel cell and the electrolyzer, are nearly identical devices, operated in a very different way.\nUsing water to make oxygen on Mars would be a great idea if we had easy access to the water. But to get water, we would have to travel to the far north or south to find ice, or to mine for ice buried deep in the ground. Fortunately, though, another source of oxygen is all around us, in the form of the carbon dioxide that makes up most of the Martian air. So instead of using hydrogen, MOXIE is an example of a solid oxide electrolyzer cell that uses carbon dioxide to make the gasses carbon monoxide and oxygen. \n\nWhy will we need oxygen on Mars?\n\nThe first human crew to go to Mars will need a lot of oxygen to breathe, as much as 2 to 3 tons. Our bodies use that oxygen to burn our fuel, which we call \"food,\" in order to make the energy that keeps us going all day. But it's not just humans who need oxygen. Nearly everything that uses fuel to make energy uses oxygen to burn that fuel, whether it's a car, a campfire, or a rocket. And it turns out that the oxygen, which on Earth we get for free from the air, actually weighs a lot more than the fuel itself.\nWhen we send the first crew to Mars, we would need to think about how to bring them home at the end of their visit. And the single biggest user of oxygen in their entire stay on Mars will be the rocket that takes them back to orbit.", "title": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars"}, {"document_id": "81c4d1f728f8d58c-2814-4885", "source": "", "score": 8.391671, "text": "Understanding Climate Change\nBut about half of the most common greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, is consumed by living things.Yet even after decades of study, it's not clear how much carbon dioxide is consumed by plants on land and eventually deposited in the soil -- and how much is taken up by sea life that then dumps our carbon on the seafloor as sediment.Answering this and related questions is vital to understanding how the atmosphere’s concentration of greenhouse gases will change in the future. As the world warms, ecosystems will change along with their ability to consume our emissions. With myriad partners, JPL scientists work hard to understand both emission sources and “sinks,” the final destination of our emissions, in such places as rain forests and peat bogs.Ecosystem Change in the CrosshairsClimate change will transform natural and unnatural ecosystems — agricultural, urban, and suburban. Some of the technologies JPL uses to trace water moving around the world are being used to study ecosystems. Seasonal and longer-term droughts are monitored from space, and so is plant respiration.

Motorcyclists continue to be overrepresented in traffic-related fatalities; Despite representing only 3% of all registered motor vehicles, motorcyclists account for 14% of all traffic-related fatalities (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2018).\n\nTaking Action\nEfforts to Improve Motorcycle Safety\n\nMotorcycle Safety Program\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles established a rider-funded motorcycle safety program as required by legislation signed in 1997. The program provides accessible and affordable rider education throughout NYS, in an effort to create awareness and reduce motorcyclist injuries and fatalities.\n\nMotorcycle Helmet Law\nNew York was the first state in the nation to adopt a universal motorcycle helmet law.

In addition to fines, court surcharges are applied to each offense and range from $260 for a conviction of Driving While Alcohol Impaired (DWAI) (a violation) to $520 for a felony offense.Separate from fines and surcharges, DMV is required by law to collect a $750 driver responsibility assessment (DRA).

Through grant funding made available to California by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the OTS funds more than $100 million dollars annually in innovative, evidence-based education and enforcement programs and technologies designed to improve road safety. The OTS evaluates all potential programs to make sure California addresses current and future traffic safety needs. Our success depends on strong partnerships. We work with approximately 300 state and local agencies to make the most effective use of federal grant program funds.

In the early days, funding, expertise, and results were scarce. Over the years, OTS staff became skilled professionals, programs expanded, and local authorities embraced the traffic safety message. Interest grew, priorities areas were established, and traffic deaths and injuries began to fall.\nEach year a Highway Safety Plan (HSP) is developed to reflect current needs as well as detailing the planned use of federal funds. The HSP identifies problems, specific performance measures, proposed solutions, time frames and fiscal information on continuing and planned new grants which are designed to mitigate traffic safety problems. OTS’ role in this cycle has proven invaluable as it provides a vital link among Federal, State and local functions.\nOTS became the national leader in innovative programs to save lives on its roadways.

The transportation system must be safe for all road users, for all modes of transportation, in all communities and for people of all incomes, races and ethnicities, ages and abilities.  \nThe OTS embraces its role in transportation safety to advance equity and to prioritize its traffic safety efforts toward any person or community that has been marginalized and burdened by poverty and inequality. Data-driven safety initiatives must be developed and administered with an equity lens to ensure our most vulnerable and underserved populations are prioritized. Our actions must be sensitive to community desires and needs, striving to include the voice of every community in traffic safety.  \nTraffic crashes continue to claim the lives of thousands of people on California roadways each year. Data analysis shows overrepresentation of people of color in crashes, including those involving fatalities. It is clear – roadway travel is riskier for people of color and this disparity has gotten worse in recent years. Several factors contribute to these results, but understanding travel patterns, where fatal and serious injury crashes are occurring and the disproportionate impacts on certain communities will allow us to identify targeted actions to address the underlying factors and causes and improve safety.  \nThe OTS is committed to taking a comprehensive, inclusive and equitable approach to delivering education, enforcement and outreach programs to save lives on all of California’s roadways. \n\n \n    \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nBack to Top\n\nContact OTS\n\nConditions of Use\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSite Map\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nX\n\nYouTube\n\nCopyright © State of California\nPowered by: CAWeb Publishing Service\n\n", "title": "Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) Equity Statement  | Office of Traffic Safety"}, {"document_id": "2fbeed88569bb243-1790-3385", "source": "", "score": 11.072719, "text": "Public Awareness and Education | Office of Traffic Safety\nOutreach efforts specifically target youth, teens, young adults and communities identified as underserved who are disproportionately impacted by traffic safety issues.\nPUBLIC AWARENESS AND EDUCATION PROGRAM AREA GOALS\n\n The “Go Safely” Brand: Increase overall public recognition of “Go Safely California” brand that defines the OTS as the voice of traffic safety, a reputable and trusted source for traffic safety information, and builds positive perceptions and support for the OTS mission of saving lives.\nOutreach and Community Engagement: Increase outreach and engagement with communities identified as underserved who are most impacted by traffic safety.

These speeds are not always posted but all California motorists are required to know these 10, 20, and 30 mile per hour speed laws.Intermediate speed limits between 25 and 55 miles per hour may be established by local authorities on the basis of traffic engineering surveys. These surveys include an analysis of roadway conditions, accident records, and the prevailing speed, or 85th percentile, of prudent drivers. If speed limit signs are posted for a lower limit than is considered reasonable, many drivers will simply ignore the signs. At the same time, other drivers will stay within the posted limits. This generally increases the conflicts between faster and slower drivers, reduces the gaps in traffic through which crossings could be made safely and increases the difficulty for pedestrians to judge the speed, of approaching vehicles.

The facts indicate otherwise. Research conducted in many parts of this country over a span of several decades has shown that drivers are influenced more by the appearance of the highway itself and the prevailing traffic conditions than by the posted speed limit. California's Basic Speed Law requires that:\"No person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at a speed greater than is responsible or prudent having due regard for weather, visibility, the traffic on, and the surface and width of the highway, and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or property.\"Under California law, the maximum speed limit for any passenger vehicle is now 65 miles per hour (MPH). All other speed limits are called prima facie limits, which \"on the face of it\" are safe and prudent under normal conditions. Certain prima facie limits are established by law and include the 25 MPH limit in business and residential districts, the 15 MPH limit in alleys, at blind intersections and blind railroad crossings and a part-time 25 MPH limit in school zones when children are going to and from school. These speeds are not always posted but all California motorists are required to know these 10, 20, and 30 mile per hour speed laws.Intermediate speed limits between 25 and 55 miles per hour may be established by local authorities on the basis of traffic engineering surveys. These surveys include an analysis of roadway conditions, accident records, and the prevailing speed, or 85th percentile, of prudent drivers.", "title": "FAQs • San Bruno, CA • CivicEngage", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "3c0f445fcb6709f5-31761-34074", "source": "", "score": 11.405379, "text": "Regulatory Agenda - NYSDEC\nContact: Barbara Lucas, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233-4255, Telephone: (518) 402-9428, E-mail: [email protected]6 NYCRR Part 190, Use of State Lands.

The Small Claims Mediation and Advisory Services provides legal \r\n advice free of charge to both the plaintiff and the defendant.\n\r\n If you choose Small Claims court to resolve a \r\n dispute and you are the plaintiff, you give up the right to have another court \r\n review the Small Claims judge's decision. In other words, the plaintiff has no \r\n right of appeal. So if you should lose, that is probably the end of the case. \r\n However, the person or entity you sue (defendant) may appeal the judge's ruling. \r\n When such an appeal is filed, the entire case will be heard again.\r\n \n\nLocation and Telephone Number\n\r\n The \r\n Carol Miller Justice Center is located at 301 \r\n Bicentennial Circle.

If you or your business wants to ask for more, you can ask for the case to be heard in regular civil court. Talk to a Small Claims Advisor to find out more.\n\nDo you have proof?\nYou don’t have to have all your proof together before you sue the other side back.

They're suing you for damages but you have a police report showing the other driver is at fault. But, you haven’t finished the body work repairs so you don’t have a bill to show how much the other driver owes you. Make sure you have the paid invoice to bring with you to your court hearing.\n\nExample: Pictures of a clean apartment\nYour landlord doesn’t want to return your security deposit and wouldn’t do a walk-through with you when you moved out. They're suing you so you'll pay for damages that cost more than your deposit.

You'd also be okay with them leaving the fence where it is and paying you $9,000. You can start a small claims case if they won't agree to pay you.\n\nEXAMPLE: returning the BBQ grill\nYou and your ex broke up and you want the BBQ grill back that you paid for. Your ex won't return it to you. In small claims court, the judge can't make your ex give you the grill, but you could ask that the judge order your ex to pay you money equivalent to the price of a used BBQ grill.\n\nIf you're not asking for money, talk to a small claims advisor\nIf you only want to ask the judge to order the other side to do something or not do something, you may need to start a regular civil court case, not a small claims case. Talk to a Small Claims Advisor or get other legal help.", "title": "Before you start a small claims case | California Courts | Self Help Guide"}, {"document_id": "fc7539e8229642aa-9013-11013", "source": "", "score": 19.016243, "text": "Before you start a small claims case | California Courts | Self Help Guide\nYour landlord didn't return your security deposit.

The person who sues is the plaintiff. The person who is sued is the defendant. In small claims court, you may ask a lawyer for advice before you go to court, but you cannot have a lawyer in court.\nYour claim cannot be for more than $10,000.00. If you have a claim for more than this amount, you may file a limited civil case, or you may sue in the small claims court and give up your right to the amount over $10,000.00. You cannot, however, file more than two cases in small claims court for more than $2,500.00 each during a calendar year.\nWho Can File a Claim?\nYou must be at least 18 years old to file a claim. If you are not yet 18, you may ask the court to appoint a guardian ad litem. This is a person who will act for you in the case. The guardian ad litem is usually a parent, relative, or an adult friend. A person who sues in small claims court must first make a demand, if possible. This means that you have asked the defendant to pay, and the defendant has refused. If your claim is for possession of property, you must ask the defendant to give you the property.\nUnless you fall within two technical exceptions, you must be the original owner of the claim. This means that if the claim is assigned, the buyer cannot sue in the small claims court. You must also appear at the small claims hearing yourself unless you filed the claim for a corporation or other entity that is not a natural person.", "title": "Small Claims | Superior Court of California | County of Tulare"}, {"document_id": "7e4251fc01e38b5d-51303-53129", "source": "", "score": 19.089108, "text": "The Superior Court of California - County of Ventura - FAQs\nA:  You must be at least 18 years of age to file a claim.

If you mediate before filing a case \r\n and an agreement is reached at the mediation, there will be no need to file a small claims case. If a case has already been filed, \r\n the agreement reached at the mediation can be entered into the court record without having to appear in court. You may also have \r\n an opportunity to mediate your case on the day of the hearing at the courthouse.\n\r\n Mediation may be particularly useful when parties have a relationship they want to preserve. So when family members, neighbors, \r\n or business partners have a dispute, mediation may be the most effective process to use. However, mediation may be beneficial in \r\n almost any kind of dispute between people. Mediation is effective even when emotions are getting in the way of resolution. An \r\n effective mediator can help the parties communicate with each other in a respectful and constructive manner.\n\nQ:  When may Small Claims mediation be inappropriate?\nA:  Mediation may not be appropriate if one of the parties is unwilling to cooperate or communicate. Mediation also \r\n may not be effective if one of the parties has a significant advantage in power over the other. Therefore, mediation may not be \r\n a good choice if the parties have a history of abuse or victimization. Mediation is not appropriate in cases in which a crime is involved.\n\nQ:  What is the role of the Small Claims mediator?\nA:  The mediator is an impartial neutral intermediary whose role is to facilitate a discussion of the issues and \r\n perspectives between the parties in an effort to help them reach an agreement. The mediator does not impose a settlement, \r\n but will assist the parties in exploring settlement options. Generally, the mediator does not communicate with the court except \r\n to file the partiesâ settlement agreement.\n\nQ:  Is Small Claims mediation confidential?\nA:  All communication, negotiations, or settlement discussions in the court of a mediation or mediation consultation \r\n are confidential.

The parties (people with a legal dispute) present their evidence to an \"arbitrator.\" The arbitrator decides who wins the case and how much they win. There are two kinds of arbitration. \"Binding\" arbitration means that the arbitrator’s decision is final. There is no appeal or trial after that decision. \"Nonbinding\" arbitration means that after the arbitration, either party can request a trial. But, if the party who requests the trial gets a worse decision at trial, there may be penalties.\nMediation\nMediation is nothing like a trial. The parties meet with a mediator in an office. The mediator may meet with the parties separately or together. The mediator listens to all the parties and tries to help them work out a solution that works for everyone. The mediator does not make a decision and does not talk to the judge about the case.", "title": "Mediation | Superior Court of California | County of Tuolumne"}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "You can mediate your case before or after a small claims case has been filed.

Time limitations for filing and processing an appeal are \r\n strictly enforced. A party who fails to comply with the time lines may be \"defaulted\" at any time during the appeals process, and may lose the right to appeal as a result.\nTime for filing appeal\nAn appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date of mailing the Notice of Entry of Judgment.

To calculate the due date, do not count the day of mailing, but count 30 calendar days beginning the day after the date shown as the mailing date \r\n on the Notice of Entry of Judgment.

No additional time is given for personal emergencies or because your papers are rejected at the filing counter.\nCost for filing an appeal\nAn $75.00 fee is charged for filing an appeal.

Create passwords that employ a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid obvious passwords—never use your birth date, mother’s maiden name, or the last four digits of your Social Security number.\nLock up your records. Keep any financial documents and records containing your sensitive information in a secure place in your home or office. Try to avoid carrying around items that contain your personal information. For digital records, consider the use of encrypted storage drives or password-protected files.\nShred sensitive documents. Tear, cut up, or shred sensitive materials, such as old records, files, bills, prescription labels, or expired credit cards before disposing of them. Once information leaves your hands, there is no way of knowing who may get their hands on it.\nSecure your wireless network. Like public or shared computers, unprotected wireless networks can put sensitive information in jeopardy. Make sure your wireless network at home is protected with a strong password, the default administrator username has been changed, and turn on Wireless Network Encryption if available.\nLock your computer. If you are using a computer at your office or in a public place, make sure to lock it before you walk away to safeguard any personal information stored on the computer.\nProtect against viruses. Regularly update anti-virus protection software on your computer. In addition, keep your computer system and browser up to date and set at the highest security level.\nDouble-check mailings. Always make sure that documents are not stuck together, and that the recipient’s information is correct before sending any Personally Identifiable Information.\nKeep your emails safe. Avoid sending any sensitive information via email.

Remember, caller ID can be faked. You can always call the organization or government agency and ask if the person works for them before giving any money.\n\n Mail fraud\n \n\nMail fraud letters look real but the promises are fake.

A scammer may use fraudulent emails, texts, or websites to steal this information from you. These emails can look authentic.\n\n Security freeze for prevention\n \n\nA security freeze prevents new creditors from accessing your credit file and others from opening accounts requiring a credit check in your name, until you lift the freeze.Because most businesses will not open credit accounts without checking your credit report, a freeze can stop identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name. Be mindful that a freeze doesn’t prevent identity thieves from taking over existing accounts.

We all enjoy finding a bargain, but do not be fooled by spam emails offering great deals or claiming they support good causes. If it seems too good to be true it probably is. Responding to or clicking on any link within an unsolicited email or pop-up box can put your personal information in jeopardy.\nGive your debit card a break. Be especially wary of using your debit card when shopping online. If an identity thief gets hold of your debit card information, he or she can drain your bank account or open new accounts in your name. If you have a credit card, use it instead. Credit cards typically provide added protection against fraudulent charges.\nBe cautious when downloading mobile applications. Mobile apps often take more data from you than they need, either for their own use or to sell to third parties. To prevent your information from getting into the wrong hands, only download applications from official app stores and check other users’ reviews, as well as the app’s privacy policies, before downloading.\nUse a variety of passwords. If you use the same password for all your online activities, and an identity thief uncovers it, he or she could have access to your bank, email, and other personal accounts. As you shop at different online retailers, choose a different password for each new account that you create. Also, avoid using your name or the names of family members in your password.

Avoid obvious passwords—never use your birth date, mother’s maiden name, or the last four digits of your Social Security number.\nLock up your records. Keep any financial documents and records containing your sensitive information in a secure place in your home or office. Try to avoid carrying around items that contain your personal information. For digital records, consider the use of encrypted storage drives or password-protected files.\nShred sensitive documents. Tear, cut up, or shred sensitive materials, such as old records, files, bills, prescription labels, or expired credit cards before disposing of them. Once information leaves your hands, there is no way of knowing who may get their hands on it.\nSecure your wireless network. Like public or shared computers, unprotected wireless networks can put sensitive information in jeopardy. Make sure your wireless network at home is protected with a strong password, the default administrator username has been changed, and turn on Wireless Network Encryption if available.\nLock your computer. If you are using a computer at your office or in a public place, make sure to lock it before you walk away to safeguard any personal information stored on the computer.\nProtect against viruses. Regularly update anti-virus protection software on your computer. In addition, keep your computer system and browser up to date and set at the highest security level.\nDouble-check mailings.

Setting boundaries for online activities and teaching children how to protect sensitive information is necessary.\nChildren in Elementary School (Ages 5-10)\nStart the conversation.  Ask questions to establish your child’s understanding of computers, the capabilities of the Internet, and what is considered personal information. Fill in any gaps in understanding that they have. Emphasize that they should never give out any information online – just as you would tell them not to talk to strangers).\nEstablish the rules. Pick a list of appropriate websites, games, and other programs. Use parental controls to limit access and block inappropriate sites.\nMonitor their playtime.

The policy of the Department is to contact parents whenever a youth is taken into custody.\n\n Arrests\n\nArrestsIn the case of a misdemeanor or felony arrest of children under 16, the Police Department must be contacted. Of course, children who break the law have the same constitutional rights as adults. When a youth is brought in for a misdemeanor or felony charge, his or her parents must be notified, and both the juvenile and the parent or guardian will be given Miranda Warnings, the rights read to an individual upon arrest. The youth can be questioned, with parents or guardian present, in the specially-designated Youth Office at the Public Safety Headquarters.MisdemeanorsMisdemeanors, including reckless endangerment, vandalism and graffiti, committed by youths under 16 may result in a New York Police Department Juvenile Report (PD377-151). Once the report is filed, we will notify the parents with a letter, which will include the name and telephone number of the Youth Officer at the 114th Precinct who is assigned to the case. These records are destroyed once the youth reaches age 16.FeloniesIn felony cases, such as assault, robbery and other serious crimes, we will either notify the Police Department to make an arrest, or, if the arrest is made by our officers, will follow the youth arrest procedures as detailed by the Criminal Justice Bureau and Family Court.\n\n Confidentiality\n\nConfidentialityAll procedures and correspondence concerning juveniles are strictly confidential, in accordance with Section 381.3 of the Family Court Act.\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nPSD Reports\n\nCivilian Complaint Form\n\nStaffing & Patrols\n\nCrisis Intervention\n\nPublic Outreach\n\nYouth\n\nCrime Prevention Tips\n\nEmergency Information \n\nPSD Community Workshop Series\n\nIsland Travel Advisory 2024\n\nLost Property\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFACEBOOK\n\nTWITTER\n\nINSTAGRAM\n\nRSS FEED\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nInstagram\n\nRSS feed\n\n \n \n \n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nDelicious\nBlogger\nLinkedIn\n\n \n \n\nHome\nMy Account\nPrinter Friendly\nEmail Page\nContact Us\nRSS", "title": "Youth | Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation of the State of New York"}, {"document_id": "05a5b959fcc60940-1337-3309", "source": "", "score": 10.79846, "text": "FAQ's\n(Answer)15.

A degree is about the with of your little finger held at arm's length. Most of us are familiar with the idea that there are 360 degrees in a circle, and that making a 180-degree turn is to face the opposite direction. If you imagine the sky as a sphere with the stars fixed onto it and pick any point, and draw a circle all the way around the sky until you return to that point, you will have rotated through 360 degrees.

Skywatching can be as casual as enjoying a couple of minutes of stargazing, and as serious as using a telescope to take images of deep sky objects. When you notice the changing position and phases of the Moon over a few days, or you search for Jupiter or Venus in the twilight sky, or you notice a constellation like Orion is visible for the first time in a few months, you're skywatching. At its heart, skywatching is an activity anyone can engage in to feel more connected to the larger world beyond planet Earth.Q: What tools do I need to start skywatching?You don't need any special equipment to get started skywatching. Online resources like this page are a great place to learn about what you can see. An app on your smartphone or computer can be a great help to discover what sights are visible tonight, and where to find them in the sky once you're outside under the stars. If you have access to binoculars or a telescope, they will extend your vision and enhance the experience – but they are by no means necessary to get started. Q: How do I find a good location for skywatching or stargazing?The number one priority when seeking an excellent location for skywatching is to get away from bright city lights.

They are the result of our planet's magnetic field and atmosphere interacting with those of the Sun. A wind of particles from our local star washes continuously over our planet, and sometimes becomes more intense. Some of those electrically charged particles become trapped in Earth's magnetic force field and get funneled into our upper atmosphere, where they produce glowing light displays as they crash into molecules of gases like oxygen and nitrogen.NASA's Eyes: Telescope ModeUnable to render the provided sourceCheck out the NASA's Eyes on the Solar System Telescope mode! Click anywhere on Earth and then click \"GO\" in order to land at that location. Click the Big Dipper icon at bottom to turn the constellations on and off, and see what's in the sky right now above that location. Tools for SkywatchingAlthough telescopes are the most powerful tool for peering deeply into the night sky, a telescope might not necessarily be the best choice for everyone. There are a variety of options for how to observe, and what's right for you depends on such factors as what you want to observe, how much effort you want to put into skywatching, and your budget. Here are some different tools to choose from for observing the skies.Your own eyes – You don't truly need any special gear to do skywatching. For the majority of people, our own eyes are often the best way to enjoy observing. Your eyes can take in panoramic views of the sky spanning 180 degrees, whereas a telescope shows only a tiny patch of the sky. Some sights are only visible when seen with the naked eye – star patterns like the constellations, lineups of the planets, and the arc of the Milky Way to name a few examples. And meteor showers are best experienced by simply lying down and looking up!Telescopes – As Galileo found over 400 years ago when he was the first to point one at Jupiter, Venus, and the Moon, telescopes allow you to observe objects in smaller areas of the sky than your eyes alone can resolve.", "title": "Skywatching - NASA Science"}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "Light pollution is caused by stray light from various human activities, including parking lots, sport complexes, street lights, and other sources.

Skywatching can be as casual as enjoying a couple of minutes of stargazing, and as serious as using a telescope to take images of deep sky objects. When you notice the changing position and phases of the Moon over a few days, or you search for Jupiter or Venus in the twilight sky, or you notice a constellation like Orion is visible for the first time in a few months, you're skywatching. At its heart, skywatching is an activity anyone can engage in to feel more connected to the larger world beyond planet Earth.Q: What tools do I need to start skywatching?You don't need any special equipment to get started skywatching. Online resources like this page are a great place to learn about what you can see. An app on your smartphone or computer can be a great help to discover what sights are visible tonight, and where to find them in the sky once you're outside under the stars. If you have access to binoculars or a telescope, they will extend your vision and enhance the experience – but they are by no means necessary to get started. Q: How do I find a good location for skywatching or stargazing?The number one priority when seeking an excellent location for skywatching is to get away from bright city lights. Scattered light from urban areas creates light pollution that washes out the fainter stars and the Milky Way. Wide open areas without lots of tall trees or mountains nearby make for good viewing spots, since you can see more of the sky. Examples include places like a large field, a wide valley, and the shore of a lake or the ocean.

We know that early civilizations tracked the movements of the Sun, Moon, planets, and other objects because they recorded their observations with words and art. Even with our busy modern lives, the night sky is still a wonderful resource. Skywatching is an activity that allows anyone to make a connection with the larger world beyond our planet's atmosphere, just by looking up. Observing the slow, continuous movement of the stars above from night to night, and month to month, is a powerful way to experience the cycle of the seasons, as the same stars and constellations reappear each year at the same time. Meanwhile, the five bright planets visible to the unaided eye – Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn – are constantly on the move.

Your own eyes will show you stars, a handful of bright planets, the Moon, comets and meteors (shooting stars), to name a few sights. Binoculars or a small telescope enable you to see finer details than your eyes can detect, making visible things like the large moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn, as well as star clusters and double stars. A larger telescope enables you to see fainter objects, like nebulas and other galaxies.How does light pollution affect skywatching?Light pollution is stray light from parking lots, sport complexes, street lights, and other human activity, scattered into the night sky. It's a combined effect of scattered light from these things that manifests as a glow in the night sky that makes it difficult to observe fainter stars and the Milky Way. The larger and more developed a city is, the more light pollution it tends to produce. The effect decreases the farther away you travel from a city. Heading out to less developed areas, away from town, will enable you to see more stars.> More about how light pollution impacts locations for stargazingCan I see ____ from my location on Earth?

Image credit: ESA/NASA/SOHO | + Expand image Scientists measure incoming solar radiation, also known as insolation, to better understand Earth’s radiation budget – the energy emitted, reflected, and absorbed by our planet. Just as clouds block sunlight and reduce insolation, eclipses create a similar phenomenon, providing a great opportunity to study how increased cloud cover can impact weather and climate. Solar eclipses can also help scientists study solar radiation in general and the structure of the Sun. On a typical day, the bright surface of the Sun, called the photosphere, is the only part of the Sun we can see. During a total solar eclipse, the photosphere is completely blocked by the Moon, leaving the outer atmosphere of the Sun (corona) and the thin lower atmosphere (chromosphere) visible. Studying these regions of the Sun’s atmosphere can help scientists understand solar radiation, why the corona is hotter than the photosphere, and the process by which the Sun sends a steady stream of material and radiation into space. Annular solar eclipses provide opportunities for scientists to practice their observation methods so that they'll be ready when a total solar eclipse comes around. Citizen scientists can get involved in collecting data and participating in the scientific process during the eclipse through NASA’s GLOBE program. Anyone in the path of the eclipse and in partial eclipse areas can act as citizen scientists by measuring temperature and cloud cover data and report it using the GLOBE Observer app to help further the study of how eclipses affect Earth’s atmosphere. Visit NASA's Eclipse Science page to learn more about the many ways scientists are using the eclipse to improve their understanding of Earth, the Moon, and the Sun. Taking Eclipse Science Farther Eclipses also make a great jumping-off point to concepts and techniques used in astrophysics and our search for planets beyond our solar system. Similar to a solar eclipse, a transit occurs when a planet crosses in front of the face of a star. From Earth, the planets Venus and Mercury can occasionally be seen transiting in front of the Sun, appearing as small, dark dots. Transits are also useful for detecting exoplanets – distant planets around other stars.", "title": "Education News & Blogs – NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory"}, {"document_id": "573a69e582e4148f-4193-6360", "source": "", "score": 15.194302, "text": "Eclipses - NASA Science\nYou can only take your glasses off during the short time when the Moon completely obscures the Sun – known as the period of totality.

The type of eclipse that people get to see depends on how the Moon aligns with Earth and the Sun, and how far away the Moon is from Earth. There are three types of lunar eclipses: total, partial, and penumbral. At least two partial lunar eclipses happen every year, but total lunar eclipses are rare. Unlike a solar eclipse, it is always safe to look at a lunar eclipse with the naked eye.Learn MoreFrom left to right, this image shows a total solar eclipse, annular solar eclipse, and partial solar eclipse.

Annular solar eclipses provide opportunities for scientists to practice their observation methods so that they'll be ready when a total solar eclipse comes around. Citizen scientists can get involved in collecting data and participating in the scientific process during the eclipse through NASA’s GLOBE program. Anyone in the path of the eclipse and in partial eclipse areas can act as citizen scientists by measuring temperature and cloud cover data and report it using the GLOBE Observer app to help further the study of how eclipses affect Earth’s atmosphere. Visit NASA's Eclipse Science page to learn more about the many ways scientists are using the eclipse to improve their understanding of Earth, the Moon, and the Sun. Taking Eclipse Science Farther Eclipses also make a great jumping-off point to concepts and techniques used in astrophysics and our search for planets beyond our solar system. Similar to a solar eclipse, a transit occurs when a planet crosses in front of the face of a star. From Earth, the planets Venus and Mercury can occasionally be seen transiting in front of the Sun, appearing as small, dark dots. Transits are also useful for detecting exoplanets – distant planets around other stars. When an exoplanet passes in between its star and Earth, we can measure tiny dips in the star's brightness that tell scientists a planet is there even when it’s too small to see. Another way that eclipse concepts are used for astrophysics is with coronagraphs, mechanisms inside telescopes that block the light from a star. By creating a sort of artificial eclipse, coronagraphs help scientists search for exoplanets by making much dimmer planets orbiting a star easier to see. For example, NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Telescope, slated for launch later this decade, will use an advanced coronagraph to analyze and directly image planets that orbit other stars.

Sometimes they appear in the morning, before dawn, and at other times they are visible in the evening sky following sunset. Occasionally they group together to form pairs, trios, or lineups across the sky. Add to that the occasional meteor shower, eclipse, or comet, and there are many thrills to seek out in your skywatching adventures. These cosmic sights have fascinating stories to tell about our solar system and the universe beyond. There are tales of heroes and mythical creatures from cultures around the globe. Skywatching is also a great way to connect NASA's exploration of space with what you can see in the skies directly above.NASA has lots of online resources to support your stargazing.

How it works A pinhole camera works because the small hole you made with your pin, paper clip, or pencil acts like a tiny camera lens. Light from the Sun enters the pinhole (or the holes in an object like a colander), it gets focused, and then it is projected out of the other side of the hole. When the projected light reaches a surface, like the second piece of paper, you can see the image that passed through the pinhole.Learn more in the video above from artist Bob Miller's Light Walk at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, California.\n \n\nRelated TagsEarthEarth's MoonEclipseSolar EclipseAnnular EclipsePinhole CameraCamera ObscuraBuilding With PaperSunJump ToMaterials1.

(Printing on 11x17 cardstock is recommended, but other printer papers work, too.) As you build, learn about the mission's six toaster-size cubesats and how they will study solar activity, creating 3D maps of the Sun's radio emissions and magnetic field lines.You can also challenge yourself to make your own cereal box eclipse viewer, like so: + Expand image\n\n9. How it works A pinhole camera works because the small hole you made with your pin, paper clip, or pencil acts like a tiny camera lens. Light from the Sun enters the pinhole (or the holes in an object like a colander), it gets focused, and then it is projected out of the other side of the hole. When the projected light reaches a surface, like the second piece of paper, you can see the image that passed through the pinhole.Learn more in the video above from artist Bob Miller's Light Walk at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, California.\n \n\nRelated TagsEarthEarth's MoonEclipseSolar EclipseAnnular EclipsePinhole CameraCamera ObscuraBuilding With PaperSunJump ToMaterials1.

Remember to also use special filters over the lenses of cameras, telescopes, or binoculars when looking at the Sun. The only time during a solar eclipse when it’s safe to look at the Sun without eclipse glasses is during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun’s bright face. Ask an adult for help looking at the Sun.\n\nTotal solar eclipses happen somewhere around the world about once a year. But because the Moon casts a fairly small shadow, these eclipses can only be seen from a small area on Earth each time.\nOther things can also pass between us and the Sun and block some of its light. When this happens, it is called a transit. Different things like planets, comets, spacecraft, and even birds can transit the Sun.\n\nHow to Play\nThe goal of this game is to snap photos of eclipses and objects that transit the Sun.

Eclipse glasses are NOT the same as regular sunglasses; regular sunglasses are not safe for viewing the Sun. During a total solar eclipse, you must wear your eclipse glasses (or use other solar filters) to view the Sun directly during the partial eclipse phase. You can only take your glasses off during the short time when the Moon completely obscures the Sun – known as the period of totality.

Thus, when counties resumed processing eligibility redeterminations on a monthly basis beginning April 1, 2023, it was for enrollees whose renewal month was June 2023. This means that the first individuals determined to be no longer eligible for Medi‑Cal lost coverage on July 1, 2023. \nState Planned Extensively and Supplemented County Funding in Preparation for Redeterminations. For most of the pandemic, the precise end date of the continuous coverage requirement was unknown because the federal government acted several times to continue its enforcement. However, given the long duration of the requirement, DHCS and counties were able to plan for its eventual end. In May 2022, DHCS released the Medi‑Cal COVID‑19 Public Health Emergency Operational Unwinding Plan, which detailed how the state intended to resume normal eligibility operations. In addition, DHCS has communicated its plans through stakeholder engagement and direction to counties. That said, Medi‑Cal caseload is extraordinarily high relative to historical levels, making the unwinding of continuous coverage a huge administrative effort for counties. In recognition of this, the 2022‑23 budget supplemented county administration funding with $146 million ($73 million General Fund) over multiple fiscal years to support the increase in county workload to process eligibility determinations. (County administration funding is over $2 billion per year, with about 30 percent coming from the state General Fund.) \nSeveral Waivers and Flexibilities Meant to Limit Disruption to Enrollees and Simplify Process for Counties and Enrollees. A stated goal of the administration during the unwinding of continuous coverage is to maximize continuity of coverage for those enrolled in Medi‑Cal. In addition, DHCS has sought to increase county capacity to process redeterminations in light of the extraordinary administrative task they face. To achieve these goals, the state has secured federal approval for a number of flexibilities.

COVID-19 is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new virus in humans causing respiratory illness which can be spread from person-to-person. Early in the outbreak, many patients were reported to have a link to a large seafood and live animal market; however, later cases with no link to the market confirmed person-to-person transmission of the disease. Additionally, travel-related exportation of cases occurred.\nTransmission\nThere are three main ways that COVID-19 can spread:\n\nBy breathing in air carrying droplets or aerosol particles that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus when close to an infected person or in poorly ventilated spaces with infected persons\nBy having droplets and particles that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth – especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze\nBy touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the SARS-CoV-2 virus particles on them\n\nThe droplets that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus are released when someone with COVID-19 sneezes, coughs, or talks. Infectious droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

The spacecraft control system consists of four hemispherical resonator gyros, two star trackers, reaction wheels, and hydrazine thrusters. Pointing accuracy is 200 microradians with 65 microradian knowledge. Thermal control is achieved by insulating blankets, surface radiators, finishes, and heaters. The spacecraft has two redundant RAD750 computers with 309 MB each of memory for scientific data.\n\nThe Impactor\n\nThe impactor projectile is made of primarily copper (49%) and only 24% aluminum so it will be easily identifiable and minimize contamination in the spectra after the projectile is largely vaporized and mixed in with the comet ejecta on impact. The impactor is a short hexagonal cylinder built above the copper cratering mass. It has a small hydrazine propulsion system for targeting which can provide delta-V of 25 m/s. Targeting is accomplished using a high-precision star-tracker, auto-navigation algorithms, and the Impactor Targeting Sensor (ITS), a camera which provides images for autonomous control and targeting. The ITS will operate until impact, and images will be sent back to Earth via the flyby spacecraft. Damage to the instrument due to dust in the coma may make imaging impossible duing the last minute or so before impact. Communication with the flyby spacecraft is via S-band. The impactor is mechanically and electrically connected to the flyby spacecraft until 24 hours prior to encounter. After separation it runs on internal battery power.\n\nFor the Deep Impact Impactor (DII) spacecraft record, see:\n\nhttp://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2005-001D\n\nMission Profile\n\nDeep Impact launched on 12 January 2005 at 18:47:08.574 UT (1:47:08 p.m. EST) on a Delta II.

Observations were made of the ejecta, much of which represented pristine material from the interior of the comet, the crater formation process, the resulting crater, and outgassing from the nucleus, particularly the newly exposed surface. The scientific objectives of the mission are to: improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus; determine properties of the surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition from the crater and its formation; study the relationship between the surface layers of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior by comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact; and improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface. This project was selected as a Discovery class mission in July, 1999. After the primary mission, Deep Impact was selected for a two-part extended mission designated EPOXI.\n\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\n\nThe spacecraft consists of a 370 kg cylindrical copper impactor attached to a 650 kg flyby bus.

The spacecraft made three close Earth / Moon flybys to target itself for Hartley 2, on 31 December 2007, 29 December 2008, and 27 June 2010. Scientific observations of the Earth and Moon were made. The encounter with Hartley 2 took place on 4 November 2010 at approximately 14:00 UT (10:00 a.m. EDT) at a distance of roughly 700 km. The spacecraft and comet were 1.064 AU from the Sun and 0.156 AU from Earth at encounter. Approach phase angle was 86 degrees, MRI resolution at closest approach was 7 m per pixel. The two extended missions together are known as EPOXI. Following Hartley 2, remote observations were made of Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) and comet ISON (C/2012 S1). After a period in which communications could not be established in 2013, it was concluded on 16 September 2013 that the spacecraft was lost, and end of mission was announced on 19 September. Total cost of the extended mission is $40 million.\n\nComet Tempel 1\n\nComet 9P/Tempel 1 is a periodic comet which orbits the Sun every 5.51 years. It has a semi-major axis of 3.12 astronomical units (AU, the distance from the Sun to the Earth) and a perihelion distance of 1.5 AU, which puts it between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its orbit is inclined 10.5 degrees to the ecliptic. The orbit has changed in the past but the perihelion has been within 10 AU for at least 300,000 years. The nucleus is estimated to be roughly 14 km long and 4 km wide. The perihelion occurs on 5 July 2005, the day after the encounter. The comet was discovered on 3 April 1867 by Ernst Wilhelm Leberecht Tempel and was first recognized to be periodic in May of that year by C. Bruhns.\n\nComet Hartley 2", "title": "NASA - NSSDCA - Spacecraft - Details", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "0d2796c897962ee0-1690-3736", "source": "", "score": 13.842867, "text": "NASA - NSSDCA - Spacecraft - Details\nScientific objectives included imaging the nuclei at resolutions of 4 m, performing spectral mapping of the nuclei at resolutions of 100-200 m, and obtaining detailed compositional data on gas and dust in the near-nucleus environment, with the goal of improving our knowledge of the characteristics of comet nuclei.\n\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\n\nThe CONTOUR spacecraft has a total fueled mass of 775 kg, including a Star 30 SRM booster with a mass of 377 kg and 70 kg of hydrazine fuel. Power is provided by a body-mounted solar array designed for operation at distances between 0.75 and 1.5 AU from the Sun. It is three-axis stabilized for encounters and spin-stabilized during cruise mode between encounters. Communications are through a fixed 0.45 m diameter high-gain antenna which will support data rates greater than 100 kbit/sec at encounters. Data and images are stored on two 3.3 Gbit solid-state recorders with a capacity of 600 images. The spacecraft is equipped with four primary science instruments, the Contour Remote Imager/Spectrograph (CRISP), the Contour Aft Imager (CAI), the Dust Analyzer (CIDA), and the Neutral Gas Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS).\n\nMission Profile\n\nCONTOUR launched on a Delta 7425 (a Delta II Lite launch vehicle with four strap-on solid-rocket boosters and a Star 30 third stage) on 3 July 2002 at 6:47:41 UT (2:47:41 a.m. EDT) into a high-apogee Earth orbit with a period of 5.5 days from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Following a series of phasing orbits, the command was given to fire the Star 30BP solid rocket motor on 15 August 2002 at 08:49 UT to perform an injection maneuver to eject CONTOUR from Earth orbit and put it in a heliocentric trajectory.\n\nContact was not regained 46 minutes after the scheduled firing as planned. It was assumed the firing was at least partially completed, on 16 August three objects were observed on the approximate trajectory CONTOUR would have entered if the firing had ended 3 seconds early. When no contact was made by 20 December, the mission was declared lost.", "title": "NASA - NSSDCA - Spacecraft - Details"}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "Certainly! 1.

Observations were made of the ejecta, much of which represented pristine material from the interior of the comet, the crater formation process, the resulting crater, and outgassing from the nucleus, particularly the newly exposed surface. The scientific objectives of the mission are to: improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus; determine properties of the surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition from the crater and its formation; study the relationship between the surface layers of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior by comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact; and improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface. This project was selected as a Discovery class mission in July, 1999. After the primary mission, Deep Impact was selected for a two-part extended mission designated EPOXI.\n\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\n\nThe spacecraft consists of a 370 kg cylindrical copper impactor attached to a 650 kg flyby bus. The spacecraft is a box-shaped honeycomb aluminum framework with a flat rectangular Whipple debris shield mounted on one side to protect components during comet close approach. Body mounted on the framework are one high- and one medium-resolution instrument, each of which consists of an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer which will be used to observe the ejected ice and dust, much of which will be exposed to space for the first time in over 4 billion years. The medium resolution camera has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at 700 km distance and is used for navigation and context images. The high resolution camera has a FOV of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km.", "title": "NASA - NSSDCA - Spacecraft - Details"}, {"document_id": "0c4d7fef596217da-1-2169", "source": "", "score": 14.636693, "text": "Discovery Program\nDiscovery Program NASA's Discovery Program \r\r\rThe primary goal of NASA's Discovery program is to conduct a series of \rfrequent, highly focused, cost-effective missions to answer critical \rquestions in solar system science.

Observations were made of the ejecta, much of which represented pristine material from the interior of the comet, the crater formation process, the resulting crater, and outgassing from the nucleus, particularly the newly exposed surface. The scientific objectives of the mission are to: improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus; determine properties of the surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition from the crater and its formation; study the relationship between the surface layers of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior by comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact; and improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface. This project was selected as a Discovery class mission in July, 1999. After the primary mission, Deep Impact was selected for a two-part extended mission designated EPOXI.\n\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\n\nThe spacecraft consists of a 370 kg cylindrical copper impactor attached to a 650 kg flyby bus. The spacecraft is a box-shaped honeycomb aluminum framework with a flat rectangular Whipple debris shield mounted on one side to protect components during comet close approach. Body mounted on the framework are one high- and one medium-resolution instrument, each of which consists of an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer which will be used to observe the ejected ice and dust, much of which will be exposed to space for the first time in over 4 billion years. The medium resolution camera has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at 700 km distance and is used for navigation and context images. The high resolution camera has a FOV of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km.", "title": "NASA - NSSDCA - Spacecraft - Details"}, {"document_id": "b033aa2800ec0652-14612-17072", "source": "", "score": 9.030066, "text": "For Colleges and Universities - NASA\nNASA's Impact on Our Lives\nNASA’s Technology Transfer program ensures that technologies developed for missions in exploration and discovery are broadly available to the public, maximizing the benefit to the nation. From eco-friendly food alternatives to precision eye surgery, the list of NASA spinoffs goes on for lightyears! \n\nLearn More\n\n \n\n\tResearch On The Station\t\n\n\tResearch Opportunities for Professionals\t\n\n\tScience Activation\t\n\n\tCitizen Science\t\n\nGet Your Research On The Station\n\nReference information and resources to provide insight into sending your science experiment or technology demonstration to the space station.\nConducting research on the ISS National Laboratory demonstrates to U.S. citizens and the world that space is accessible, affordable, and capable of supporting the research and development necessary to make the fundamental business case for sustainable industrial demand in low Earth orbit. \n\n\tLearn More \t\n\n \n\nResearch Opportunities for Professionals\n\nFind Opportunities for Funding and More\nSupporting research in science and technology is an important part of NASA’s overall mission. \n\n\tLearn More \t\n\n \n\nScience Activation\n\nNASA Science Events and Activities\nLet NASA’s Science Activation program bring the universe to you!

It will also keep out microbes which are needed to break down your waste. If you use a closed bin make sure to add a shovel full of soil from the ground.Keep your bin somewhere convenient to use and access. It can be helpful to have a hose within reach if weather is dry.Pallets make great open compost bins and free if you can get a hold of them. They should be stamped, look for ones that say HT for heat treated.

At the end of the process, liquids are separated from solids. The wastewater solids are then treated physically, biologically, or chemically to reduce pathogens, stabilize organic compounds, and reduce the volume of material. Composting is a highly effective treatment to stabilize and prepare biosolids for use as a soil amendment or mulch in landscaping, horticulture, agriculture, and land remediation. Biosolids management and use is determined by the federal regulation Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 503.

Windrow composting often requires equipment such as front-end loaders, excavators, or windrow turners.\nIn-Vessel\nIn-vessel composting can process a variety of organic materials without taking up much space. This method involves feeding materials into a vessel, such as a drum, silo, concrete-lined trench, or similar enclosed equipment. The materials are then mechanically turned or mixed in the vessel with bulking agents like wood chips to ensure aeration. Vessels, also known as bioreactors, vary in size and capacity. A similar composting method that takes place in an enclosed area is an agitated bay system where mixing and aerating equipment moves compost along walled bays or beds as it decomposes and stabilizes.\nWorm Composting (Vermicomposting)\n\n Resources\n \n\nCheck out EPA’s Home Composting page as well as vermicomposting resources from North Carolina State University Cooperative Extension.\n\nWorm composting, or vermicomposting, relies on earthworms and microorganisms to break down organic materials into vermicompost, or worm castings, a high-quality soil amendment. A vermicomposting system can be indoors or outdoors in the shade and sized to match the volume of food scraps put into the system. Vermicomposting can used by households, schools, farms, institutions, and businesses. A properly maintained vermicomposting system does not produce odors or attract pests.\nIt is essential to use a suitable worm species, such as red wrigglers (Eisenia fetida).

Passive aeration is caused by warm air heated by microbial activity rising to the top of the pile as cool air is drawn in through the sides and bottom of the pile to replace it, known as the “chimney effect.” When mixing organic materials in the pile, it is important to ensure there is enough free air space throughout the pile to support aeration. Adding bulking agents such as wood chips creates a less dense pile for oxygen to flow. Also, turning the pile occasionally is recommended to encourage even decomposition. This method usually does not get the pile hot enough to break down materials such as meat, bones, and dairy products.\n\nBins to contain compost can be constructed from materials such as wire, wood, and cinder blocks; enclosed barrels or tumblers for small volumes are also available for purchase. Three-bin systems are a common model, with each bin containing compost at a different stage of the process, from freshly added organic materials to finished compost.\nStatic Pile with Active Aeration\nActively aerated static piles use blower systems to move air through the pile. “Positive” aeration is when air is blown through pipes beneath or inside the pile; “negative” aeration draws air down through the pile. Air blower systems can be activated by a timer or a temperature sensor and piles may be covered to help control the pile temperature and moisture level. This method of composting speeds up the composting process by carefully controlling the pile conditions and works with large quantities and all types of materials.\nWindrow\nWindrow composting consists of forming long, narrow rows or “windrows” roughly twice as wide as they are high and as long as space allows. Windrows are the most common method of composting in the United States. Windrows can be turned periodically or have perforated pipes underneath them to allow air flow.

Pile conditions within that range will promote rapid decomposition and destroy pathogens and weed seeds. Above that temperature range, beneficial microorganisms cannot survive. Below that range, decomposition will occur more slowly, and pathogens and weed seeds may remain in the final compost. Pile temperatures must remain at 131 degrees Fahrenheit or above for several days to meet standards for reducing pathogens. The exact amount of time depends on the method of composting. Controlling the oxygen, moisture, pile structure, and nutrient balance helps achieve the optimal temperature range in a compost pile.\nModels of Composting\nComposting can take place at a range of scales and locations. Site and facility management can be public, private, or a combination. Materials arrive at composting sites through different collection programs.\nThe fundamentals of composting are the same no matter the size or scale of an operation. However, the volume of materials composted, the types of feedstock, and the composting methods and equipment used may differ. Composting operations that handle large volumes of materials and certain feedstocks - such as biosolids or manures - may have additional permitting or zoning requirements, depending on state and local regulations.\n\nBackyard/Home Composting\nBackyard/home composting occurs in residential settings – often in a backyard pile or a small, enclosed bin. Vermicomposting, or worm composting, is also an option for home composters. Home composting systems mostly handle food scraps (except for meat, bones, and dairy products) and yard trimmings. By composting at home, households reduce their trash going to the landfill or incinerator and use the compost they produce in their garden, yard, or house plants. To learn more, visit EPA’s Home Composting webpage.\nCommunity Composting", "title": "Approaches to Composting | US EPA", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "41168a49b304126a-14897-16951", "source": "", "score": 17.156694, "text": "Approaches to Composting | US EPA\nA properly maintained vermicomposting system does not produce odors or attract pests.\nIt is essential to use a suitable worm species, such as red wrigglers (Eisenia fetida). Worms are kept in a closed bin or system that should be shielded from light and rain, with sufficient air flow, and a way to drain excess liquid. The ideal temperature for a vermicomposting system is 55 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Earthworms survive at 32 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit with at least four inches of bedding and insulation around the bin during colder months.\nComposting Biosolids\nBiosolids are a product of the wastewater treatment process. At the end of the process, liquids are separated from solids. The wastewater solids are then treated physically, biologically, or chemically to reduce pathogens, stabilize organic compounds, and reduce the volume of material. Composting is a highly effective treatment to stabilize and prepare biosolids for use as a soil amendment or mulch in landscaping, horticulture, agriculture, and land remediation.

Windrows can be turned periodically or have perforated pipes underneath them to allow air flow. Small to large volumes and a wide variety of materials can be composted using this method, which makes it adaptable to many scales and sites for composting. Windrow composting often requires equipment such as front-end loaders, excavators, or windrow turners.\nIn-Vessel\nIn-vessel composting can process a variety of organic materials without taking up much space. This method involves feeding materials into a vessel, such as a drum, silo, concrete-lined trench, or similar enclosed equipment. The materials are then mechanically turned or mixed in the vessel with bulking agents like wood chips to ensure aeration. Vessels, also known as bioreactors, vary in size and capacity. A similar composting method that takes place in an enclosed area is an agitated bay system where mixing and aerating equipment moves compost along walled bays or beds as it decomposes and stabilizes.\nWorm Composting (Vermicomposting)\n\n Resources\n \n\nCheck out EPA’s Home Composting page as well as vermicomposting resources from North Carolina State University Cooperative Extension.\n\nWorm composting, or vermicomposting, relies on earthworms and microorganisms to break down organic materials into vermicompost, or worm castings, a high-quality soil amendment. A vermicomposting system can be indoors or outdoors in the shade and sized to match the volume of food scraps put into the system. Vermicomposting can used by households, schools, farms, institutions, and businesses. A properly maintained vermicomposting system does not produce odors or attract pests.\nIt is essential to use a suitable worm species, such as red wrigglers (Eisenia fetida). Worms are kept in a closed bin or system that should be shielded from light and rain, with sufficient air flow, and a way to drain excess liquid. The ideal temperature for a vermicomposting system is 55 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.", "title": "Approaches to Composting | US EPA", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "41168a49b304126a-3039-5240", "source": "", "score": 13.127341, "text": "Approaches to Composting | US EPA\nA mismatched ratio of carbon to nitrogen may lead to odors, pests, or incomplete decomposition of materials in the pile.\nPile Structure\nThe size of particles in a compost pile and the size of the pile itself impact how oxygen, water and microorganisms move through the pile. Chopping, chipping, or shredding materials into smaller pieces before adding them to a compost pile increases the surface area on which microorganisms can feed. Smaller particles produce a more homogeneous compost mixture and improve pile insulation to help maintain optimum temperatures. Larger particles decrease the density of the compost, creating space for air and water to flow through the pile. A balanced distribution of large and small particle sizes supports optimal density and porosity. Finished compost is often screened to remove large particles or items that did not fully decompose and which can be added into the next round of composting.\nMoisture Content\nMicroorganisms living in a compost pile need enough moisture to survive. Water is the key element that helps transport substances within the compost pile and makes the nutrients in the organic material accessible to microbes. Feedstocks such as food scraps contain some moisture in varying amounts, but moisture may also come in the form of rainfall or intentional watering. It is important to prevent too much water from entering the system to avoid anaerobic or low or no oxygen conditions.\nOxygen Flow\nComposting is an aerobic process. Aerating the pile aids the decomposition process by providing oxygen that microorganisms need to breathe. Turning the pile, blowing air into the pile through pipes or vents, and adding bulking agents such as wood chips and dry leaves to the pile all help increase aeration.\nTemperature\nBeneficial microorganisms in a compost pile require a certain temperature range for optimal activity – 131 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Pile conditions within that range will promote rapid decomposition and destroy pathogens and weed seeds. Above that temperature range, beneficial microorganisms cannot survive. Below that range, decomposition will occur more slowly, and pathogens and weed seeds may remain in the final compost.", "title": "Approaches to Composting | US EPA"}, {"document_id": "41168a49b304126a-11461-13699", "source": "", "score": 12.52049, "text": "Approaches to Composting | US EPA\nThese piles rely on passive aeration rather than active aeration to maintain optimal temperature and oxygen levels. Passive aeration is caused by warm air heated by microbial activity rising to the top of the pile as cool air is drawn in through the sides and bottom of the pile to replace it, known as the “chimney effect.” When mixing organic materials in the pile, it is important to ensure there is enough free air space throughout the pile to support aeration. Adding bulking agents such as wood chips creates a less dense pile for oxygen to flow. Also, turning the pile occasionally is recommended to encourage even decomposition. This method usually does not get the pile hot enough to break down materials such as meat, bones, and dairy products.\n\nBins to contain compost can be constructed from materials such as wire, wood, and cinder blocks; enclosed barrels or tumblers for small volumes are also available for purchase. Three-bin systems are a common model, with each bin containing compost at a different stage of the process, from freshly added organic materials to finished compost.\nStatic Pile with Active Aeration\nActively aerated static piles use blower systems to move air through the pile. “Positive” aeration is when air is blown through pipes beneath or inside the pile; “negative” aeration draws air down through the pile. Air blower systems can be activated by a timer or a temperature sensor and piles may be covered to help control the pile temperature and moisture level. This method of composting speeds up the composting process by carefully controlling the pile conditions and works with large quantities and all types of materials.\nWindrow\nWindrow composting consists of forming long, narrow rows or “windrows” roughly twice as wide as they are high and as long as space allows. Windrows are the most common method of composting in the United States. Windrows can be turned periodically or have perforated pipes underneath them to allow air flow. Small to large volumes and a wide variety of materials can be composted using this method, which makes it adaptable to many scales and sites for composting.

Step 1: Pick Out A Bin - The bin should be at least 3x3x3 feet in size. The location can affect how fast your compost dries out or holds water. A closed bin is recommended to keep critters out. If you use a closed bin, add a shovel full of soil from the ground. Keep your bin somewhere convenient to use and access. Step 2: Gather Materials - Browns are higher in carbon, and greens are higher in nitrogen. The optimal ratio is 3 parts brown to 1 part green. Avoid feces from cats and dogs, invasive plants, weed seeds, oil, fats, plastics, or non-organic matter. Gather kitchen waste in a container by your sink. Step 3: Maintain - If you have an open bin, layer some small sticks and twigs at the bottom to help with air and drainage. Layer your browns and greens, imagining you're making a bowl for your greens to lay in the middle and then adding more browns on top. Keep your compost at 40-60% water content, like a wrung out sponge. Turning helps a pile break down faster and ensures oxygen is present. Step 4: Harvest and More! - You will know when your compost is done when it has an earthy smell and looks like rich dark soil. If you do not fully turn the pile, your finished compost will be at the bottom of the pile. If you're running out of browns, shredded newspaper, paper towel, and toilet paper rolls make good brown additions.

You can recycle right by folding cardboard boxes and removing any non-paper contaminants such as loose tape or plastic packaging before placing your cardboard boxes in the recycling bin. Do NOT include foam, bubble wrap or shipping envelopes in your recycling bin. However, there are special drop-off recycling programs for some of these materials. Plastic film such as bubble wrap, air pillows and plastic shipping envelopes can go back to retail stores as part of their plastic film recycling program.

Reusing gift bags/ boxes and buying non-metallic wrapping paper or brown craft paper can reduce waste this holiday season. Don't forget to reuse ribbon and bows to add some extra holiday flare. You can also add a unique and personal touch by using newspaper or brown craft paper and draw your own designs!Avoid wrapping paper and gift bags with metallic, foil or glittery elements as these cannot be recycled. \n\n \n \n \n\nReuse Your Paper Bags for Gift Wrap: Did you run out of wrapping paper or wanted to try something new?

Step 1: Pick Out A Bin - The bin should be at least 3x3x3 feet in size. The location can affect how fast your compost dries out or holds water. A closed bin is recommended to keep critters out. If you use a closed bin, add a shovel full of soil from the ground. Keep your bin somewhere convenient to use and access. Step 2: Gather Materials - Browns are higher in carbon, and greens are higher in nitrogen. The optimal ratio is 3 parts brown to 1 part green. Avoid feces from cats and dogs, invasive plants, weed seeds, oil, fats, plastics, or non-organic matter. Gather kitchen waste in a container by your sink. Step 3: Maintain - If you have an open bin, layer some small sticks and twigs at the bottom to help with air and drainage. Layer your browns and greens, imagining you're making a bowl for your greens to lay in the middle and then adding more browns on top. Keep your compost at 40-60% water content, like a wrung out sponge. Turning helps a pile break down faster and ensures oxygen is present. Step 4: Harvest and More! - You will know when your compost is done when it has an earthy smell and looks like rich dark soil. If you do not fully turn the pile, your finished compost will be at the bottom of the pile. If you're running out of browns, shredded newspaper, paper towel, and toilet paper rolls make good brown additions.

You could also program your game to reduce point totals in certain scenarios (see Step 6, for example).\nTasks\n\nDevelop code to create a scoring system.\nIncrease the score by one or more points for each sample tube collected.\n\n+ Expand image\n\n6.

Add landing code Every Mars rover has to first land on the Red Planet before it can start exploring. You can specify a landing site by creating scripts that place the rover at a certain location at the beginning of the game.Tasks Create code that puts the rover in a specific location at the beginning of the game. Bonus: Modify your landing code to make the rover land in a random location on the backdrop image or in a random location within a smaller section of the backdrop image.About the image: This animated image is a clip from a video taken by the Perseverance rover mission as the rover was being lowered onto the surface of Mars. › Full video and caption\n\n8.

The Perseverance Mars rover is designed to take that data collection one step further by gathering rock cores in sample tubes and leaving them on the surface for a future \"fetch rover\" to collect. The fetch rover would collect the samples and bring them to a Mars ascent vehicle – a rocket that would carry the samples from the surface to orbit around Mars – for eventual return to Earth.In this project, you will use Scratch, a visual programming language, to create a video game that simulates the way NASA collects samples on Mars! \n\nMaterials Computer with internet accessFree Scratch accountMars fetch rover sprite – Download PNGMars sample collection tube sprite – Download PNG Jezero crater surface images – Download ZIP\n\n1.

You will use mirrors to move the laser and avoid obstacles to get the data back to Earth. Each level has new challenges and your ultimate goal is to build a communication network and synchronize, or match, the time on atomic clocks.\n\nAbout the mission\nOptical communication uses lasers to send data with a type of light that we can’t see, called infrared light. Since the 1950s, NASA missions have used a different type of waves, called radio waves, to send data to and from space. With current radio wave communications, it takes about nine weeks to send a complete map of Mars back to Earth. With lasers, it only takes about nine days!\nOptical communication is very useful for space missions because data can be sent faster and more securely. Optical communication systems are also smaller, weigh less, and use less power. A smaller size means more room for science instruments, and using less power means less of a drain of the spacecraft’s batteries. These are all very important details for NASA when designing and creating mission concepts.

The Blueprint further determined that between March 2020 and December 2020, Unemployment Insurance benefits reached the families of approximately 3.6 million California children, reaching about 40% of the state’s children supporting those households in the first year of the pandemic. \n \n\nGender is a substantive element of the health of the state’s overall workforce and capacity for economic growth and must be considered as an essential element in state resource stewardship.\n\nCalifornia has barreled toward recovery, with overall unemployment rates falling to 3.9%, a historic low going back to the official data series started in 1976. The state as a whole has accounted for 16.1% of the nation’s new jobs as of July 2022 and has recovered all of the private-sector jobs lost during the pandemic. \nOne thing these numbers do not tell us, however, is the type of work, compensation, flexibility, or the intangible elements of work, including caregiving.

It is vital for healthy aging and can reduce the burden of chronic diseases and prevent early death. Yet, only about 1 in 4 adults and 1 in 6 high school students fully meet the recommendations in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.\nAccess to safe places to play and walk, such as parks, safe streets, trails, and greenways, is important for physical activity. It is also important to be able to safely and easily walk, bike, or take transit to everyday destinations such as homes, workplaces, schools, parks, health care, and food outlets.\nAdditionally, many people from racial and ethnic minority groups and from rural areas are less likely to have access to these safe spaces. Historical land use as well as housing and transportation policies can contribute to limited access. People impacted by these disparities are also less likely to meet the physical activity recommendations.\nDesigning communities to provide access to these safe spaces for everyone helps increase physical activity and can provide better places to live. It can also help improve health equity.\nConnect activity-friendly routes to everyday destinations\nTip‎\nImplement policies and activities to connect pedestrian, bicycle, or transit transportation networks (called activity-friendly routes) to everyday destinations.To align with the Community Preventive Services Task Force's built environment recommendation, increasing physical activity through community design needs to include at least one element from activity-friendly routes plus one element from everyday destinations. Possibilities for each are below.\nSee recommendation\n\nActivity-Friendly Routes\n\nEveryday Destinations\n\nThese may include new or improved:\r\n\nStreet pattern design and connectivity, such as convenient, connected, and accessible streets that create many route options, shorter block lengths, and shorter crossing distances.", "title": "Strategies for Physical Activity Through Community Design | Physical Activity | CDC"}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "Yes, being active can positively influence children's academic performance.

I spent lots of weekends hiking or going on bike rides with friends. But 2 pregnancies in just over 4 years changed all that!\nAfter my second child was born, I was constantly tired and just didn’t have any energy. I knew it was partly because I wasn’t getting enough sleep at night — but I also realized that I missed getting active. I found that getting outside even for just 15 minutes and taking a quick walk gave me an energy boost, and it helped me feel more like my old self. I take the kids along in the stroller — sometimes we stop by the park, and my older child and I play ball while the baby naps.\nThat’s not to say getting active is easy with a young child and a baby in the house! Taking them with me on walks is a challenge sometimes — and when I finally get some time to myself after the kids are in bed, physical activity usually isn’t the first thing on my list.

Taking them with me on walks is a challenge sometimes — and when I finally get some time to myself after the kids are in bed, physical activity usually isn’t the first thing on my list. But I try my best to get active a few times a week, whether it’s outside or with an online exercise video. I don’t always get to do as much as I’d like, but that’s okay! I like knowing that even a little bit of activity relieves some stress and helps me stay healthy — and it’s setting a good example for my kids.\n\n \n\nAdults need a mix of physical activity to stay healthy\n\n \n\n \n\nModerate-intensity aerobic activity\nAdults need at least 150 minutes each week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity. Anything that gets the heart beating faster counts! Brisk walking is a great option if you’re recovering from childbirth or if you’re just starting to get active — and you can do it almost anywhere. Invite a friend along for some social time while you get moving!\n\n \n\nMuscle-strengthening activity\nIt’s also important to do muscle-strengthening activities 2 days a week — that’s anything that makes your muscles work harder than usual.\n\n \n\nHow I make every bite count\n\nI grew up eating home-cooked meals, and I always thought I’d give my kids the same experience. But taking care of young children doesn’t leave much time for cooking — I’m not interested in anything that takes more than 30 minutes to make. The faster I can put together a meal, the better.\nIt’s also a challenge to find healthy foods that work for all of us — a young kid who’s still figuring out what they like, a baby who’s just starting to eat solid foods, and myself. I want to make sure we all get the nutrients we need, but at first I had no idea how to do that with so many different preferences to take into account.\nI talked to our family doctor about my concerns, and she shared some good advice: It’s absolutely okay not to cook a whole meal.

It increases your risk of having heart disease, a stroke, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Choosing heart-healthy foods and getting regular exercise will help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Also, find ways to reduce stress, which affects energy and hunger and, if chronic, can make your body store more fat.\nIf your doctor diagnosed you with overweight or obesity, it’s important to follow their recommendations for losing weight. Health professionals recommend losing 5% to 10% of your initial weight over the course of about 6 months. But a loss of just 3% to 5% of your current weight can lower triglycerides and glucose levels in your blood, as well as your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Losing more than 3% to 5% of your weight can improve blood pressure readings, lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, and increase “good” HDL cholesterol.\nIf you need to lose weight, connecting with others can help keep you on track. Try these:\nJoin a weight loss program with a buddy.\nSign “social support” agreements with three family members or friends.\nGet your kids involved. Explain that it's important to sit less and move more to stay at a healthy weight and that they’ll have more energy to ride a bike or shoot hoops. Tell them you’ll do the same.\n\nThis video shows how little things we do each day can add up and lead to weight gain. Gaining 10 pounds adds more than 30 pounds of force to your knees, which can cause aches and pains. Taking action by eating healthy and getting physical activity can lower the risk of developing serious health problems.", "title": "Take Action Toward Better Heart Health: | NHLBI, NIH"}, {"document_id": "838fffa336b64b99-2847-5118", "source": "", "score": 8.916592, "text": "West Nile Virus | Sierra County, CA - Official Website\nTake steps to avoid West Nile virus infection.How do I protect myself from West Nile virus?There is no vaccine to prevent West Nile virus infection.The best way to prevent diseases spread by mosquitoes is to protect yourself and your family from mosquito bites.Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants.Stay in places with air conditioning and window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.Treat your clothing and gear with permethrin or buy pre-treated items.Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents.Always follow the product label instructions.When used as directed, these insect repellents are proven safe and effective even for pregnant and breastfeeding women.Do not use insect repellents on babies younger than 2 months old.Do not use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol on children younger than 3 years old.Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.If you have a baby or child:Do not use insect repellent on babies younger than 2 months old.Do not use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol on children younger than 3 years old.Dress your child in clothing that covers arms and legs.Cover crib, stroller, and baby carrier with mosquito netting.Do not apply insect repellent onto a child’s hands, eyes, mouth, and cut or irritated skin.Adults: Spray insect repellent onto your hands and then apply to a child’s face.More InformationInformation on West Nile virus from CDC.Information on insect repellent use and effectiveness from the EPA.The American Academy of Microbiology (AAM) comprehensive report published in 2013 called West Nile virus FAQ [1.58 MB]Information on West Nile virus from CDC.Information on insect repellent use and effectiveness from the EPA.The American Academy of Microbiology (AAM) comprehensive report published in 2013 called West Nile virus FAQ [1.58 MB]Content provided and maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Taking them with me on walks is a challenge sometimes — and when I finally get some time to myself after the kids are in bed, physical activity usually isn’t the first thing on my list. But I try my best to get active a few times a week, whether it’s outside or with an online exercise video. I don’t always get to do as much as I’d like, but that’s okay! I like knowing that even a little bit of activity relieves some stress and helps me stay healthy — and it’s setting a good example for my kids.\n\n \n\nAdults need a mix of physical activity to stay healthy\n\n \n\n \n\nModerate-intensity aerobic activity\nAdults need at least 150 minutes each week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity.

It is vital for healthy aging and can reduce the burden of chronic diseases and prevent early death. Yet, only about 1 in 4 adults and 1 in 6 high school students fully meet the recommendations in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.\nAccess to safe places to play and walk, such as parks, safe streets, trails, and greenways, is important for physical activity. It is also important to be able to safely and easily walk, bike, or take transit to everyday destinations such as homes, workplaces, schools, parks, health care, and food outlets.\nAdditionally, many people from racial and ethnic minority groups and from rural areas are less likely to have access to these safe spaces. Historical land use as well as housing and transportation policies can contribute to limited access. People impacted by these disparities are also less likely to meet the physical activity recommendations.\nDesigning communities to provide access to these safe spaces for everyone helps increase physical activity and can provide better places to live. It can also help improve health equity.\nConnect activity-friendly routes to everyday destinations\nTip‎\nImplement policies and activities to connect pedestrian, bicycle, or transit transportation networks (called activity-friendly routes) to everyday destinations.To align with the Community Preventive Services Task Force's built environment recommendation, increasing physical activity through community design needs to include at least one element from activity-friendly routes plus one element from everyday destinations.

In an emergency, every second counts.\n\nBe aware of the conditions. \r\n\t\nOcean swimming is very different from pool swimming, so be prepared for powerful waves, strong surf and sudden drop-offs. \nRip currents usually form near a shallow point in the water, and can happen at any beach with breaking waves, including the Great Lakes. If you are caught in a rip current, try to remain calm and\r\n\tdon't fight it. Swim parallel to the shore until you are out of the current, and float or tread water if you begin to tire. More from the National Weather Service: Break the Grip of the Rip! \nKeep away from the water's edge. Jagged, slippery rocks and murky waters can be hazardous.\n\nBe aware of the rules.\r\n\t\nSwim only in designated areas, and only when a lifeguard is on duty. Prohibited swim areas are often accompanied by dangers such as turbulent underwater currents, extreme cold, and widely varying depths. \r\n\tThese hazards can put even good swimmers at risk.\nChoose a swimming spot near a lifeguard for maximum visibility. Always follow their directions, and ensure that any children you are swimming with do the same.\nWatch for warning flags and know what they mean. Green flags usually mark designated swimming areas - be sure to swim between the green flags. Yellow flags may denote a surfing beach or an advisory. \r\n\tRed flags indicate a danger or hazard.

As New York State Parks celebrate their Centennial in 2024, NY SWIMS also reverses decades of disinvestment to ensure public parks offer new, state-of-the-art swimming facilities which can serve thousands of daily visitors. Disparate access to safe and convenient opportunities for swimming has denied far too many New Yorkers the chance to engage with the water and learn foundational water safety skills. Drownings in New York State have reached record highs in recent years, claiming the lives of 230 New Yorkers in 2021 (the last year data is available) and more than 1,000 New Yorkers from 2017 to 2021. Drowning now ranks as the leading cause of death among children aged one to four years old in the United States, and it is the second-leading cause of death for children aged 5 to 14. Without equitable and widespread access to safe swimming opportunities, fewer people will develop foundational swimming and water safety skills, more people will swim in unsafe waterways without lifeguards, and more preventable drowning deaths will continue to occur each year. \n\n Contact the Governor’s Press Office\n \n\n Contact us by phone:\n \nAlbany: (518) 474 - 8418New York City: (212) 681 - 4640\n\n Contact us by email:\n \n[email protected]\n\n Translations\n \n\nArabic Translation\n\n الترجمة إلى العربية\n \n\nDownload\n\nBengali Translation\n\n বাংলা অনুবাদ\n \n\nDownload\n\nChinese Translation\n\n 中文翻譯\n \n\nDownload\n\nFrench Translation\n\n Traduction en français\n \n\nDownload\n\nHaitian-Creole Translation\n\n Tradiksyon kreyòl ayisyen\n \n\nDownload\n\nItalian Translation\n\n Traduzione italiana\n \n\nDownload\n\nKorean Translation\n\n 한국어 번역\n \n\nDownload\n\nPolish Translation", "title": "As Part of NY SWIMS Initiative, Governor Hochul Announces Up to $90 Million Available for Municipal Swimming Facilities in Underserved Communities | Governor Kathy Hochul"}, {"document_id": "ad0544154450d496-1665-3901", "source": "", "score": 11.4993305, "text": "As Part of NY SWIMS Initiative, Governor Hochul Announces Up to $90 Million Available for Municipal Swimming Facilities in Underserved Communities | Governor Kathy Hochul\nThe first application round will make up to $90 million available for municipal swimming facility projects in underserved communities across New York State. The remaining NY SWIMS capital funding will be made available during subsequent application periods. “Drownings in New York State have reached record levels in the last few years, and our kids are particularly vulnerable,” Governor Hochul said. “Through NY SWIMS, we’re making sure that all New Yorkers know how to swim through the largest statewide investment in swimming since the New Deal. We look forward to municipalities taking advantage of this opportunity to create new ways to provide children and their families safe spaces to learn how to swim and prevent childhood drowning.”Included in Governor Hochul’s FY 2025 Enacted Budget and State of the State proposals, the program offers grants between $50,000 and $10 million to acquire, design, construct or reconstruct facilities, provide major renovations, improvements, and modernization or rehabilitation of swimming facilities and natural swimming areas. The Request for Applications for the first round of funding was posted today at www.dasny.org and www.parks.ny.gov. The first application period for the NY SWIMS capital grant will open on June 13, 2024, and applications must be submitted by July 12, 2024. Awards are expected to be announced no earlier than August 28, 2024. Applications will be evaluated on characteristics of projects’ need, impact, and viability. NY SWIMS grants will require applicants to provide a 20 percent matching contribution towards the overall project cost. In addition to various costs to develop swimming areas, NY SWIMS funds are also available to support ancillary projects, including splash pads, concession stands, picnic areas, and playgrounds. Funds for these costs are limited to 10 percent of grants awarded for any individual project. Recognizing that drowning is the leading cause of death for children ages 1-4 and that climate change will increase extreme heat events, NY SWIMS will build out municipal swimming facilities in high-need areas, connect New Yorkers to the State’s rivers and lakes, deploy pools in urban environments, and invest in State parks and pools.", "title": "As Part of NY SWIMS Initiative, Governor Hochul Announces Up to $90 Million Available for Municipal Swimming Facilities in Underserved Communities | Governor Kathy Hochul"}, {"document_id": "eef1cf2550d82aa8-4177-6475", "source": "", "score": 10.913945, "text": "Facility Information and FAQs | City of Morgan Hill, CA - Official Website\nCan my child work out at the CRC?CRC Fitness Center and Group Exercise Age Restrictions effective 2021The CRC welcomes children ages 8 - 9 into the Fitness Center and Group Exercise classes, when accompanied and directly supervised by a parent or guardian.

They may claim to be a U.S. Marshal, saying you must pay a fine for missing jury duty. Or the IRS, saying that you owe thousands in back taxes. Some might threaten legal action, deportation, or arrest if you do not pay up or give them your financial information.These are all scams. Scammers will try to make themselves seem legitimate.

Once payment is made, little or no works is done and the project is abandoned.High Pressure Sales: A fast-talking operator might push you for an immediate decision about work, which makes it impossible for you to get the recommended three competitive bids, check their license, obtain building permits, or review references.Scare Tactics: A scam artist may offer to perform a free inspection, then claim that a serious problem such as faulty wiring, bad plumbing, or a leaky roof, will put you in danger.", "title": "Common Scams and Schemes | Danville, CA", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "040af5da2ab87936-1805-3968", "source": "", "score": 14.416014, "text": "Common Scams and Schemes | Danville, CA\nThis scam occurs when someone gets an email or most often a phone call and the caller begins speaking very quickly about common computer issues that slow performance or even potential hacks to your system. The high pressure tactics are designed to convince you that they need immediate access to your PC to make urgent repairs to your operating system or to stop a hack already in progress.Some of these callers even claim to be from or affiliated with Microsoft in an effort to legitimize their scam. Microsoft currently does not use second or third party contractors for such services and they have specific protocol in place for assisting clients with service and software issues.Many times these scammers will charge a small initial fee only to bill you for larger amounts after the phone call is ended. Again pre-loaded cards, credit or debit cards are the preferred method of payment with money transfers always a suitable option for the scammer. Winners are Losers in Lottery & Sweepstakes Scams: You get a card, call, or email telling you that you won! Maybe it’s a lottery, sweepstakes, or some other prize. The person calling is excited and cannot wait for you to get your winnings.But here is what happens next: they tell you there is a fee, some taxes, or customs duties to pay. They ask for your bank account information, or ask you to send money via a wire transfer or to purchase gift cards and provide the card numbers. Whichever way you send it, you lose money instead of winning it. You never get that big prize. Instead, you get more requests for money, and more promises that you have won big.

These emails can look authentic.\n\n Security freeze for prevention\n \n\nA security freeze prevents new creditors from accessing your credit file and others from opening accounts requiring a credit check in your name, until you lift the freeze.Because most businesses will not open credit accounts without checking your credit report, a freeze can stop identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name.

They often combine new technology with old tricks to get people to send money or give out personal information.  Don’t be fooled – “If it’s too good to be true, it probably is.” If you experience a scam, report it to the Danville Police Department and to the Federal Trade Commission using the following link:  Federal Trade Commission  Your reports help the FTC and other law enforcement investigate scams and bring crooks to justice.\n\n \n \n \n\nCommon Phone and Mail Schemes Occurring in The AreaIncarcerated Relative Scam: The victim receives a phone call from someone claiming a relationship to them; usually grandchild, child or sibling. The caller will indicate that the \"relative\" has been involved in some type of law enforcement interaction such as a car crash or an arrest. The caller requests funds for bail, an attorney or perhaps insurance deductible fees.Please verify the relationship with actual family members! Do not be pressured into wiring money without verification. Wired transactions that are not halted within the first 15-30 minutes are usually non-reversible causing the victim to be out of pocket of any funds wired. The callers can be very convincing and often target older adults and senior citizens.Computer Repair / Microsoft Scam: Computer repair scams are on the rise, and unsuspecting citizens can fall prey to these smooth talking sales pitches if they are uninformed. This scam occurs when someone gets an email or most often a phone call and the caller begins speaking very quickly about common computer issues that slow performance or even potential hacks to your system.

Maybe it’s a lottery, sweepstakes, or some other prize.

They ask for your bank account information, or ask you to send money via a wire transfer or to purchase gift cards and provide the card numbers. Whichever way you send it, you lose money instead of winning it. You never get that big prize. Instead, you get more requests for money, and more promises that you have won big.

Once payment is made, little or no works is done and the project is abandoned.High Pressure Sales: A fast-talking operator might push you for an immediate decision about work, which makes it impossible for you to get the recommended three competitive bids, check their license, obtain building permits, or review references.Scare Tactics: A scam artist may offer to perform a free inspection, then claim that a serious problem such as faulty wiring, bad plumbing, or a leaky roof, will put you in danger.", "title": "Common Scams and Schemes | Danville, CA", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "f81a8bb78e5bbc6f-5426-7600", "source": "", "score": 13.350959, "text": "Fraud and scam answers | Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\nIdentity theft occurs when someone steals your identity to commit fraud.Stealing your identity could mean using personal information without your permission, such as your name, Social Security number, bank account information, or credit card number.

Remember, caller ID can be faked. You can always call the organization or government agency and ask if the person works for them before giving any money.\n\n Mail fraud\n \n\nMail fraud letters look real but the promises are fake. A common warning sign is a letter asking you to send money or personal information now to get something valuable after you send the money or information.\n\n Phishing\n \n\nIn phishing, a scammer impersonates a business or a person to trick you into giving out your personal information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account information. A scammer may use fraudulent emails, texts, or websites to steal this information from you. These emails can look authentic.\n\n Security freeze for prevention\n \n\nA security freeze prevents new creditors from accessing your credit file and others from opening accounts requiring a credit check in your name, until you lift the freeze.Because most businesses will not open credit accounts without checking your credit report, a freeze can stop identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name. Be mindful that a freeze doesn’t prevent identity thieves from taking over existing accounts.

The state created the original Middle Class Scholarship program in the 2013‑14 budget package to provide partial tuition coverage to certain UC and CSU students. Originally, awards were for students who were not receiving tuition coverage through the Cal Grant program or other need‑based financial aid programs. In 2022‑23, the state implemented a new set of rules for the Middle Class Scholarship program. The new program focuses on total cost of attendance (rather than only tuition). Under the new program, students may use their awards for nontuition expenses, such as housing and food. \nAward Amounts Are Now Calculated Based on Total Cost of Attendance. Middle Class Scholarship award amounts now vary widely among students, with each student’s award reflecting their costs and available resources. As Figure 4 shows, calculating each student’s award amount involves several steps. Starting with a student’s total cost of attendance, CSAC deducts the student’s available resources, consisting of other gift aid, a student contribution from part‑time work earnings, and in some cases a parent contribution. (The parent contribution only applies to dependent students with a household income of more than $100,000.) This calculation determines the student’s remaining costs. Next, CSAC determines what percentage of each student’s remaining costs it can cover based on the annual state appropriation for the program. Awards cover the same percentage of remaining costs for each student, except foster youth receive awards that cover 100 percent of their remaining costs. \n\nFigure 4\nMiddle Class Scholarships Are Calculated Using Multicomponent Formula\nIllustrative CSU Dependent Student With $110,000 Household Income, 2023‑24\n\nAward Calculation\n\nCost of attendance\n\n$30,000\n\nOther federal, state, and institutional gift aida\n\n‑5,742\n\nStudent contribution from work earnings\n\n‑7,898\n\n33% of parent contribution from federal EFCb\n\n‑6,300\n\nStudent’s Remaining Costs\n\n$10,060", "title": "The 2024-25 Budget: California Student Aid Commission"}, {"document_id": "b03966276e8c8526-1486-3686", "source": "", "score": 9.121792, "text": "The 2024-25 Budget: California Student Aid Commission\nThe increase is due primarily to higher‑than‑expected program costs for community college entitlement awards, especially as more recipients of these awards transfer to public universities. From the revised 2023‑24 level, the Governor’s budget further increases Cal Grant spending by $148 million (6.2 percent) in 2024‑25, bringing total program spending to $2.5 billion. This above‑average growth rate reflects a projected increase in recipients, combined with a projected increase in average award amounts primarily due to university tuition increases. \nMiddle Class Scholarship Award Amounts Would Decrease Under Governor’s Budget. As of 2022‑23, the Middle Class Scholarship is based on a student’s total cost of college attendance rather than only tuition. Students’ awards now reflect a certain percentage of their remaining cost of attendance after accounting for their available resources. Each year, CSAC determines the percentage of award coverage based on the program funding level. Under last year’s budget agreement, the state would have provided a total of $926 million General Fund (consisting of $637 million ongoing and $289 million one time) for the program in 2024‑25. Due to the state budget condition, the Governor’s budget forgoes the one‑time funds but retains the ongoing funds. We estimate the proposed funding level would cover 24 percent of students’ remaining costs in 2024‑25—down from 36 percent in 2023‑24. \nRecommend Pulling Back Unspent Funds From Two Recent One‑Time Initiatives. In 2021‑22 and 2022‑23, the state provided one‑time General Fund appropriations of $500 million each for Golden State Teacher Grants and the Learning‑Aligned Employment Program. We estimate $223 million for Golden State Teacher Grants and roughly $485 million for the Learning‑Aligned Employment Program remained unspent as of January 1, 2024. Given the state budget deficit, we recommend the Legislature pull back these unspent funds. The Legislature might want to take early action to maximize savings, as less funding will remain available by the end of the fiscal year. \n\nIntroduction\nBrief Focuses on CSAC Budget.

(Applies to applicants under 18 years of age) \nIf your DE/DT were completed in a state other than California, DMV will accept a letter from your out-of-state secondary school on the school’s official stationery. The letter must be signed by a school official stating that the completed courses you have taken are equivalent to a California secondary school course as described in Section 10020 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations and on form “To Secondary Schools Other Than California Schools” (DL 33). Obtain a DL 33 form from your local DMV office or by calling DMV at 1-800-777-0133. Send the DL 33 form to your out-of-state school for completion. An out-of-state driving instruction permit is not acceptable proof of DE/DT.\nWhat if my provisional instruction permit expires before I take the driving test?", "title": "Instruction and Learner's Permits - California DMV"}, {"document_id": "2946b6131be9cbab-6292-8430", "source": "", "score": 15.382456, "text": "Instruction and Learner's Permits - California DMV\nVisit a DMV office (schedule an appointment), where you will:\n\nBring your California Identification Card or proof of identity and residency.

A degree is about the with of your little finger held at arm's length. Most of us are familiar with the idea that there are 360 degrees in a circle, and that making a 180-degree turn is to face the opposite direction. If you imagine the sky as a sphere with the stars fixed onto it and pick any point, and draw a circle all the way around the sky until you return to that point, you will have rotated through 360 degrees.

Skywatching can be as casual as enjoying a couple of minutes of stargazing, and as serious as using a telescope to take images of deep sky objects. When you notice the changing position and phases of the Moon over a few days, or you search for Jupiter or Venus in the twilight sky, or you notice a constellation like Orion is visible for the first time in a few months, you're skywatching. At its heart, skywatching is an activity anyone can engage in to feel more connected to the larger world beyond planet Earth.Q: What tools do I need to start skywatching?You don't need any special equipment to get started skywatching. Online resources like this page are a great place to learn about what you can see. An app on your smartphone or computer can be a great help to discover what sights are visible tonight, and where to find them in the sky once you're outside under the stars. If you have access to binoculars or a telescope, they will extend your vision and enhance the experience – but they are by no means necessary to get started. Q: How do I find a good location for skywatching or stargazing?The number one priority when seeking an excellent location for skywatching is to get away from bright city lights.

They are the result of our planet's magnetic field and atmosphere interacting with those of the Sun. A wind of particles from our local star washes continuously over our planet, and sometimes becomes more intense. Some of those electrically charged particles become trapped in Earth's magnetic force field and get funneled into our upper atmosphere, where they produce glowing light displays as they crash into molecules of gases like oxygen and nitrogen.NASA's Eyes: Telescope ModeUnable to render the provided sourceCheck out the NASA's Eyes on the Solar System Telescope mode!

Click the Big Dipper icon at bottom to turn the constellations on and off, and see what's in the sky right now above that location. Tools for SkywatchingAlthough telescopes are the most powerful tool for peering deeply into the night sky, a telescope might not necessarily be the best choice for everyone. There are a variety of options for how to observe, and what's right for you depends on such factors as what you want to observe, how much effort you want to put into skywatching, and your budget. Here are some different tools to choose from for observing the skies.Your own eyes – You don't truly need any special gear to do skywatching. For the majority of people, our own eyes are often the best way to enjoy observing. Your eyes can take in panoramic views of the sky spanning 180 degrees, whereas a telescope shows only a tiny patch of the sky. Some sights are only visible when seen with the naked eye – star patterns like the constellations, lineups of the planets, and the arc of the Milky Way to name a few examples. And meteor showers are best experienced by simply lying down and looking up!Telescopes – As Galileo found over 400 years ago when he was the first to point one at Jupiter, Venus, and the Moon, telescopes allow you to observe objects in smaller areas of the sky than your eyes alone can resolve.", "title": "Skywatching - NASA Science"}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "Light pollution is caused by stray light from various human activities, including parking lots, sport complexes, street lights, and other sources.

Comet 12P will peak around a magnitude 5 unless an outburst occurs.\nHowever, Cooke warns that outbursts are unpredictable. “There have been minor outbursts roughly once a month but it’s impossible to predict them,” he said. “The last one was on Leap Day, Feb. 29.”\nWill the comet be visible during the eclipse?\nIt is certainly a possibility. If Comet 12P remains around a magnitude 5, it would only be visible in binoculars during the few minutes of totality.

Why should I recycle food scraps?\n\nA. Properly sorting your food scraps and food soiled paper not only helps fight climate change, it's now the law. Effective January 2022, State law (SB 1383) requires all residents and businesses to keep compostable and recyclable materials of of California's landfills and subscribe to organics collective services. Food scraps and food soiled paper are the largest single item in our waste stream - making up approximately 35% of what we throw away in Alameda County. Food scraps are a resource, not a waste. By participating in the food scrap recycling program, food scraps and food soiled paper are sent to a composting facility. Instead of taking up space in the landfill, your food scraps become compost - a valuable resource used by landscapers and farmers. The result is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a healthier environment. To learn more, visit the http://stopfoodwaste.org website.\n\nQ. How do I recycle food scraps?\n\nA. Collect food scraps and food-soiled paper in the green kitchen pail.

If you choose not to participate, you may receive an improper facility use fine as laid out by the State of California (Government Code Sections 53069.4, 25132, 36900). \n\n3.\nWhy are the requirements changing?\n\nA focus on recovering and recycling organic materials is vital to California’s efforts to combat climate change. When organic materials such as food scraps, yard trimmings, and paper decompose anaerobically (without oxygen) in a landfill, they produce methane — one of the most potent climate pollutants in the atmosphere and a major contributor to climate change. \n\n4.\nWhat are the fines for improper facility use? \n\nIf self-haulers do not abide by the organic waste requirements as laid out by the State of California, they are subject to improper facility use fines. For violations occurring after January 1, 2024, the State of California requires all jurisdictions to issue a Notice of Violation requiring compliance within 60 days. If after 60 days, the entity is still not in compliance, the jurisdiction is required to impose penalties. The penalties imposed by any jurisdiction are based on Government Code Sections 53069.4, 25132 and 36900 and are as follows:First violation: $50-$100 per violationSecond violation: $100-$200 per violationThird or subsequent violation: $250-$500 per violation \n\n5.\nWhy is recycling organic waste important?\n\nOrganics recycling helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air and water quality, and create valuable resources such as compost, renewable energy and mulch. In addition, it conserves natural resources by reducing the need for raw materials used in producing compost, mulch and renewable energy. This contributes to overall sustainability efforts and helps preserve ecosystems. \n\n6.\nAre there additional resources available?\n\nCalRecycle and local authorities may provide support and resources to help self-haulers understand and comply with SB 1383 requirements. This includes educational materials, training programs and tools such as the Record-keeping Tool for Self-Haulers, designed to facilitate compliance with record-keeping obligations. \n\nLive Edit", "title": "FAQs • Morgan Hill • CivicEngage"}, {"document_id": "fe8c82cdf4a51f27-3063-5393", "source": "", "score": 10.646977, "text": "\r\n\tFAQs - City of Piedmont\r\n\nQ. How can I save money?\n\nA. There are four ways to reduce the cost of garbage collection service.\n\nService rates are based upon the size of your garbage cart. Collection service for recyclables and organics is unlimited in volume and provided at no additional cost. By recycling more and generating less garbage, you may be able to switch to a smaller garbage cart to save money. But be sure to choose the right container for your garbage needs. Charges will be assessed for overflowing garbage, garbage set out beyond your service level, or allowing garbage to accumulate on your property. Recycling carts and organics carts contaminated with garbage will not be serviced. Call Republic Services at (800) 320-8077 to order additional or larger carts for recyclables and organics.\nOn-premises (backyard) collection service costs more than curbside service. Switching to curbside service saves approximately $50 per month. With curbside collection, the customer is responsible for placing the wheeled carts at the curb on their regular collection service day and returning the carts to their storage location promptly after collection. With curbside collection, carts are not limited in size as they are with on-premises collection.\nAn Annual Pre-Payment Discount allows single family customers to voluntarily pay for one (1) year of service with the twelfth (12th) month of service provided at no charge. That is 12 months of service for the cost of 11 months of service.\n\n Physically disabled residential customers with no able-bodied household members are eligible to receive on-premises (backyard) collection at curbside rates. The maximum cart size available to on-premises collection is 35 gallons. To receive the discount, the account holder must fill out the application for exemption to curbside placement of carts, provide a doctor's certification that the customer is unable to move the carts to the curb or provide a copy of a valid California Disability Placard, and verify that there are no able-bodied household members that can move the carts to the curb.\n\nService Rates for Single Family Residences\n\nQ.

The blue recycling cart should be kept next to the black and green carts and does not need to be taken to the curb.\n\nCustomers who have opted to have Curbside collection service should place all their carts within three feet of the curb for collection no earlier than 6:00 p.m. on the day prior to the scheduled collection day and must remove all carts from the curb no later than 12:00 midnight on the scheduled collection day. Customers may not place carts in a public street, or public sidewalk, but may place carts in the right-of-way parking strip. To help reduce scavenging, please place the carts out before 7:00 a.m.\n\nShould you need a trash enclosure to screen your bins please see the Trash Enclosure Information Brochure.\n\nQ.

The result is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a healthier environment. To learn more, visit the http://stopfoodwaste.org website.\n\nQ. How do I recycle food scraps?\n\nA. Collect food scraps and food-soiled paper in the green kitchen pail. Empty the pail contents into the large green Organics cart for collection. DO NOT place the kitchen pail outside for collection. Refer to the service guide at the top of this page for additional information and hints on Food Scrap Recycling. You can also visit the http://stopfoodwaste.org website to learn more.\n\nQ. If I put my food scraps down the garbage disposal, do they get composted?\n\nA. No. These food scraps from household garbage disposals end up in the wastewater system and do not get composted. However, the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) wastewater treatment plant at the base of the Bay Bridge in Oakland not only treats sewage but takes food scraps from restaurants and supermarkets that usually go to the landfill and converts them into renewable energy. The process is a natural microbial activity called anaerobic digestion which converts these food scraps into biogas, which is used to power EBMUD's wastewater plant. The excess energy is sold back to the grid or used as carbon credits. The project supports local and regional efforts towards green- house gas reduction (climate change), oil independence, zero waste and landfill reduction.\n\nQ. I'm interested in home composting. Where can I get more information?\n\nA. Home composting information can be found on the StopWaste.org website.\n\nI am interested in Recycling the Right Way\n\nQ. Is recycling free?\n\nA.

If someone who is sensitive to this protein comes in contact with it by touching or breathing it, an allergic reaction can occur. This allergic reaction can range from a simple skin rash to shock (which is rare). The amount of latex exposure needed to produce sensitization or an allergic reaction is unknown, but frequent exposure to latex proteins increases the risk.\nPeople who experience allergic symptoms should avoid contact until medically evaluated. Some other chemicals used in the manufacture of gloves may also cause sensitization and serious reactions, particularly skin reactions.\nWhat items contain natural rubber latex?\nLatex is used in a variety of products. Many everyday items contain latex but not all brands of all these items always contain latex. Check labels or contact the manufacturer. Following are examples of some products that may contain latex:\n\nmedical devices, such as gloves, syringes, blood pressure cuffs, bandages, IV tubes and catheters;\ndental items, such as toothbrushes with rubber grips, irrigation tips, dams, orthodontic rubber bands and elastic;\nclothing items, such as the elastic waistband in pants, underwear, sneakers, socks and pantyhose, swimsuits;\nchildren's items such as bottle nipples, diapers, rubber pants, pacifiers, teething toys, infant gum massagers and toys;\nhousehold items such as flooring, rug mats, bathmats, rubber gloves, tires and mats;\npersonal care items such as diaphragms, condoms and adult diapers;\noffice supplies such as rubber bands and erasers;\nschool supplies such as erasers, rubber cement and paint.\n\nHow common is an allergy to natural rubber latex?\nIt is difficult to determine just how widespread a problem latex allergy may be. Less than 1 percent of the general population is reported to have a reaction to latex. Despite this, more than 1,700 cases of latex allergy have been reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1988. Many more cases probably go unreported. Latex allergy reactions occur more frequently in high-risk professions due to increased exposure to latex products.", "title": "Latex Allergy Information", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "05e50be28c1a4beb-6531-8314", "source": "", "score": 14.736678, "text": "Household Hazardous Waste | Madison County, NY\nBring paint to the Service Counter in the back of Parry's during store hours.Through our HHW program - please submit paint quantities under the correct category.

The law also established a statewide recycling goal of 75% by 2020. In 2016, AB 1826 (Mandatory Organics Recycling law) went into effect, requiring businesses and multifamily complexes that generated specified amounts of organic waste to arrange for organics collection services. Most recently, SB 1383 (California's Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction law), in effect as of 2022, expanded upon the goals of AB 341 and AB 1826. \n Alameda County has three recycling ordinances that are mandatory. The purpose of these ordinances is to reduce the amount of easily recyclable and compostable materials deposited in landfills from businesses, institutions, single-family and multi-family properties, and self-haulers. The ordinances are designed to help the state reach the long-term goal of reducing waste by ensuring that 75% of recyclables and compostables are diverted from the landfill by 2025. \nORGANICS REDUCTION AND RECYCLING ORDINANCE \nCalifornia State law, SB 1383, aims to keep food and other compostable materials (\"organics\") out of landfills to reduce emissions that contribute to climate change.

If you choose not to participate, you may receive an improper facility use fine as laid out by the State of California (Government Code Sections 53069.4, 25132, 36900). \n\n3.\nWhy are the requirements changing?\n\nA focus on recovering and recycling organic materials is vital to California’s efforts to combat climate change. When organic materials such as food scraps, yard trimmings, and paper decompose anaerobically (without oxygen) in a landfill, they produce methane — one of the most potent climate pollutants in the atmosphere and a major contributor to climate change. \n\n4.\nWhat are the fines for improper facility use? \n\nIf self-haulers do not abide by the organic waste requirements as laid out by the State of California, they are subject to improper facility use fines. For violations occurring after January 1, 2024, the State of California requires all jurisdictions to issue a Notice of Violation requiring compliance within 60 days. If after 60 days, the entity is still not in compliance, the jurisdiction is required to impose penalties. The penalties imposed by any jurisdiction are based on Government Code Sections 53069.4, 25132 and 36900 and are as follows:First violation: $50-$100 per violationSecond violation: $100-$200 per violationThird or subsequent violation: $250-$500 per violation \n\n5.\nWhy is recycling organic waste important?\n\nOrganics recycling helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air and water quality, and create valuable resources such as compost, renewable energy and mulch. In addition, it conserves natural resources by reducing the need for raw materials used in producing compost, mulch and renewable energy. This contributes to overall sustainability efforts and helps preserve ecosystems. \n\n6.\nAre there additional resources available?\n\nCalRecycle and local authorities may provide support and resources to help self-haulers understand and comply with SB 1383 requirements. This includes educational materials, training programs and tools such as the Record-keeping Tool for Self-Haulers, designed to facilitate compliance with record-keeping obligations. \n\nLive Edit", "title": "FAQs • Morgan Hill • CivicEngage"}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "Alameda County has indeed implemented three mandatory recycling ordinances: ORGANICS REDUCTION AND RECYCLING ORDINANCE, MANDATORY COMMERCIAL RECYCLING LAW, and PLANT DEBRIS LANDFILL BAN ORDINANCE.

With decades of experience and a long record of achievements, she is a powerful, effective attorney and lifelong public servant. When she was elected in 2018, she became the first woman of color to hold statewide office in New York and the first woman to be elected Attorney General. \n\n \nView the 2022 Year in Review \n\nIn her first term, Attorney General James focused on protecting vulnerable New York residents and ensuring that individuals or companies that broke state laws were held accountable. She secured more than $7.5 billion for New York from those who broke state laws and took advantage of New Yorkers, including more than $2.5 billion from opioid manufacturers and distributors for their roles in the opioid epidemic. Under her leadership, the Office of the New York State Attorney General helped remove more than 4,000 guns from New York communities, took down dozens of dangerous drug and gun trafficking rings throughout the state, and took legal action to stop the proliferation of ghost guns.\nAttorney General James took on predatory landlords who harassed tenants and endangered children by violating New York’s lead paint laws. She protected New Yorkers’ health and the state’s natural resources by going after polluters and companies that flouted environmental protection laws. Attorney General James stood up for vulnerable populations by going all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to stop a question about citizenship from being added to the census and successfully protecting DACA. \nShe has been a national leader in the fight to defend access to reproductive health care, leading dozens of legal actions across the country to protect and expand access to this lifesaving care.", "title": "Meet Letitia James | New York State Attorney General", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "39c95be13937c2db-3174-5508", "source": "", "score": 24.347643, "text": "Meet Letitia James | New York State Attorney General\nShe protected New Yorkers’ health and the state’s natural resources by going after polluters and companies that flouted environmental protection laws.

Attorney General James also stood up against corruption and took strong action against officials who broke New York laws or workplace protection measure, regardless of their status or political affiliation.  \n\nBefore serving as Attorney General, Letitia James was the public advocate for the City of New York. When she was elected in 2013, she became the first woman of color to hold citywide office. During her tenure as public advocate, her office passed more legislation than all previous public advocates combined, including a groundbreaking law that banned questions about salary history from the employment process to address the pervasive gender wage gap. Prior to serving as public advocate, Letitia James represented the 35th Council District in Brooklyn in the New York City Council for 10 years. As a council member, she passed the Safe Housing Act, legislation that forced landlords to improve living conditions for tenants in New York City’s worst buildings. Before her election to the City Council, Letitia James was head of the Brooklyn Regional Office of the New York State Attorney General’s Office. \nLetitia James began her career as a public defender at the Legal Aid Society. A proud Brooklynite, she is a graduate of Lehman College and Howard University School of Law.\n\n \n\nLooking for more?\n\nLearn more about the Office of the New York State Attorney General, or view our previous Year in Review. \n\nAbout the Office of the New York State Attorney General \n2022 Year in Review \n\nLetitia James\nNew York State Attorney General\n\nSocial Media\n\nContact\n\n Office of the New York State Attorney General\n The Capitol\n Albany NY 12224-0341\n Phone: 1-800-771-7755\n\nFooter\n\nStatewide Offices\n\nPress Releases\n\nFile a Complaint\n\nEmployment Opportunities\n\nCopyright ©\n 2024", "title": "Meet Letitia James | New York State Attorney General", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "b157d4efc4fcd23b-1567-3672", "source": "", "score": 23.573141, "text": "Home | New York State Attorney General\nHow can we help you?\n\nI Want To...\n\nAppeal a background check\n\nApply for a Job/Internship\n\nDo Business with the OAG\n\nFile a Complaint\n\nFind Legal Services\n\nKnow My Rights\n\nMake a FOIL Request\n\nRegister/Submit a Filing\n\nReport a Data Breach\n\nRequest a Publication\n\nServe Papers on OAG\n\nUse the Whistleblower Portal\n\n \n\nPopular Actions\n\nFile a complaint \nKnow my rights \nRegister/submit a filing \nMake a FOIL request \n\nToggle Popular Actions\n\nLetitia James is the 67th Attorney General of the state of New York.

Our CLE programs are developed specifically for state attorneys to enhance knowledge and skills relevant to public legal practice. In addition, we also offer professional-development courses and opportunities (through webinars, conferences, classroom training, and eLearning), and management training and development, and oversee agency mandated training. \n\nOffice of Diversity & Inclusion\nAttorney General Letitia James is dedicated to ensuring that the workforce of the Office of the New York State Attorney General reflects the people of New York. To advance this aim, in 2019 the Attorney General established the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion provides leadership and guidance with respect to all diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) matters within our office.\nWith the goal of fostering DEIA, in 2020 the Attorney General established the Diversity Committee. The Diversity Committee is made up of 18 members, with two members representing each of the nine divisions at the office. The Diversity Committee works with the office to increase recruitment and hiring of a diverse workforce, enhance employee engagement and retention, and foster inclusion and equity within all aspects of the office.", "title": "Administration Division | New York State Attorney General"}, {"document_id": "78d7e645edcf5be4-13941-14477", "source": "", "score": 16.805193, "text": "Social Justice Division | New York State Attorney General\nOffice of the New York State Attorney General\n The Capitol\n Albany NY 12224-0341\n Phone: 1-800-771-7755\n\nFooter\n\nStatewide Offices\n\nPress Releases\n\nFile a Complaint\n\nEmployment Opportunities\n\nCopyright ©\n 2024\n — Office of the New York State Attorney General.

Galileo deployment from space shuttle Atlantis, October 1989. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech The atmospheric entry probe carried by Galileo was developed by NASA Ames Research Center. The probe entered the Jovian atmosphere on Dec. 7, 1995, measuring the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere until it was crushed, as expected, by extreme pressure. The Galileo orbiter lasted until September 2003, when JPL ordered it to plunge into Jupiter's atmosphere to ensure that it would not crash into, and contaminate, any of Jupiter's moons. Among other things, Galileo found a water ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet, and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.JPL branches outThe downturn in planetary exploration funding during the 1970s had one welcome consequence: JPL began to seek other kinds of spaceflight tasks. This led the Lab into astronomy and Earth science.One of JPL's technology development efforts in the mid-1970s had been research on improving charge-coupled detectors (CCDs) for use in space. This work was intended for the Galileo camera system, but also resulted in the Laboratory being awarded the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera in 1978. Intended to be the observatory's primary imaging instrument, WFPC operated flawlessly when the telescope was finally launched in 1990.WFPC also helped pinpoint a manufacturing flaw in the telescope's primary mirror. It had been polished to just slightly the wrong shape. The error made Hubble a hugely expensive laughing stock shortly after launch, but JPL scientists realized they could rescue the mission by installing corrective optics in an updated camera. JPL developed the camera, WFPC2, which was installed on Hubble by astronauts in 1993, and operated until removed during a servicing mission in 2009.", "title": "History", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "4a9dd1207fbb9a07-38038-40372", "source": "", "score": 18.728434, "text": "Juno - NASA Science\nThe self-destruct maneuver would have satisfied NASA’s planetary protection requirements, avoiding any chance Juno could crash into the Jovian moons Europa, Ganymede, or Callisto – ocean worlds, with Europa in particular considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth – and contaminate them with microscopic life from Earth.  The Cassini mission, orbiting Saturn from 2004 to 2017, prompted similar concerns – protecting the integrity of Saturn’s moons Enceladus and Titan, also believed to contain possibly habitable environments. As a grand finale, the mission team plunged Cassini through the rings and into Saturn, collecting science until the end. The same fate befell NASA’s Galileo orbiter – Juno’s predecessor to Jupiter from 1995-2003, and the mission that discovered the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.  With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach. The spacecraft will continue its exploration of Jupiter, its ring system, and moons through September 2025.

After a week of observation, Galileo realized they were moons – the first discovered beyond Earth. Also secured to the spacecraft, as part of a joint outreach program between NASA and the LEGO Group, Juno carries a set of three LEGO mini-figurines. Crafted in aluminum and shielded under a thermal blanket, they represent Galileo, who is carrying a telescope, the Roman god Jupiter (wielding a lightning bolt), and the goddess Juno, his wife (holding a magnifying glass, ready to investigate). Three LEGO figurines representing the Roman god Jupiter, the goddess Juno (his wife), and astronomer Galileo Galilei are shown here aboard the Juno spacecraft. Cast in aluminum, the tiny travelers are mounted on the probe for its trip to Jupiter.NASA/JPL-Caltech/KSCFAQs and More About the MissionNASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California, manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Scott J. Bolton of Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. Juno is part of NASA’s New Frontiers Program, which is managed at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for the agency’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. Lockheed Martin Space in Denver built and operates the spacecraft. Frequently Asked QuestionsQ: What is the Juno mission? A: Juno is a solar-powered spacecraft sent to Jupiter – the first and largest planet in our solar system – to learn how it formed, and by extension how the solar system formed. Q: When was Juno launched and when did it arrive at Jupiter?", "title": "Juno - NASA Science"}, {"document_id": "4a9dd1207fbb9a07-34744-36792", "source": "", "score": 16.663445, "text": "Juno - NASA Science\nAmong other discoveries Juno made possible: JunoCam provided the first clear, close-up pictures of Jupiter’s north pole – a strange, bluish region full of giant storms and strange weather. A central cyclone at the north pole is surrounded by eight more, as if they’re bowing in tribute. These cyclones stretch more than 2,500 miles across (4,000 kilometers). And though their spiral arms smack together as they spin, the storms don’t merge. During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone in the region. A pattern of six cyclones, with one in the center, had seemed locked in place at the south pole, but a new maelstrom had somehow muscled in.Scientists knew Jupiter had an intense magnetic field. Juno showed it’s far more intense than anyone expected – in some places more than 30 times as powerful as the one surrounding Earth.  The now-departed Galileo spacecraft dropped a probe into Jupiter’s atmosphere in 1995 and found the place where it entered to be strangely dry, with one-tenth the water that scientists expected. Juno solved the mystery, showing that water is much more abundant nearer Jupiter’s equator. High-voltage electrical charges contribute to the formation of auroras at Jupiter’s poles, just as they do on Earth. But Jupiter is the solar system’s Texas: everything’s bigger. The most powerful energies there come to 400,000 electron volts, while our most powerful auroras on Earth hit only a few thousand volts. Maybe the most iconic storm in the solar system, Jupiter’s Great Red Spot has been swirling for centuries. But it appears to be slowly shrinking, from twice Earth’s size in 1979 to 1.3 times now. Juno plumbed the depths of this signature cyclone, showing that its roots run 200 miles (320 kilometers) deep — 50 to 100 times as deep as Earth’s oceans. Since April 2022, Juno has been observing the volcano-covered moon Io. and has sent back images that appear to show fresh lava fields, in areas last seen in visible-light images during Galileo and New Horizon flybys (in 1999 and 2007).", "title": "Juno - NASA Science"}, {"document_id": "4a9dd1207fbb9a07-39739-41950", "source": "", "score": 16.639519, "text": "Juno - NASA Science\nAnd Juno’s work continues building on the discoveries of previous missions that visited Jupiter – Pioneer 10 and 11, and Voyager 1 and 2 in the 1970s, then the Galileo orbiter and its atmospheric probe, as well as those spacecraft who made key observations while en route to other targets (Ulysses, Cassini, and New Horizons). In turn, Juno is also preparing the way for future visitors, such as ESA’s Juice mission (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer), launched in April 2023 and scheduled to reach Jupiter in July 2031.

Underneath its dense cloud cover, Jupiter safeguards secrets to the fundamental processes and conditions that likely governed our solar system as it formed. Our primary example of a giant planet, Jupiter can also help us understand planetary systems being discovered around other stars.  Theories about solar-system formation all begin with the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust, or nebula, the bulk of which went into forming the infant Sun. Like the Sun, Jupiter is mostly hydrogen and helium, so it must have formed early, capturing most of the material left over after our star came to be. How this happened, however, is unclear.  Unlike Earth, Jupiter's giant mass allowed it to hold onto its original composition; like a time capsule, it provides us with a way to trace our solar system's history. Deciphering the origin and evolution of Jupiter will help us understand the formation of the rest of the solar system, including how Earth came to be, and how it became a haven for life. Juno completed its primary mission by mid-2021, offering revelations about Jupiter’s interior structure, atmosphere (including polar cyclones, deep atmosphere, and auroras), and magnetosphere – the vast region around the planet influenced by Jupiter's uniquely intense magnetic field. Now Juno has pivoted to an extended mission, in which NASA’s most distant planetary orbiter expands on the discoveries it already made, while also exploring the full Jovian system. That includes the dust in the planet’s faint rings, and three of Jupiter’s four Galilean Moons – Ganymede, Europa, and Io – so named because in 1610 Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei was the first to identify the quartet of satellites (Callisto is the fourth – farther out than the other three, and not visited by Juno). seeing what galileo sawJupiter's MoonsIn January 1610, astronomer Galileo Galilei saw four points of light near Jupiter; but they didn't traverse the sky like other stars, they remained close to the planet.

The probe entered the Jovian atmosphere on Dec. 7, 1995, measuring the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere until it was crushed, as expected, by extreme pressure. The Galileo orbiter lasted until September 2003, when JPL ordered it to plunge into Jupiter's atmosphere to ensure that it would not crash into, and contaminate, any of Jupiter's moons. Among other things, Galileo found a water ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet, and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.JPL branches outThe downturn in planetary exploration funding during the 1970s had one welcome consequence: JPL began to seek other kinds of spaceflight tasks. This led the Lab into astronomy and Earth science.One of JPL's technology development efforts in the mid-1970s had been research on improving charge-coupled detectors (CCDs) for use in space. This work was intended for the Galileo camera system, but also resulted in the Laboratory being awarded the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera in 1978. Intended to be the observatory's primary imaging instrument, WFPC operated flawlessly when the telescope was finally launched in 1990.WFPC also helped pinpoint a manufacturing flaw in the telescope's primary mirror. It had been polished to just slightly the wrong shape. The error made Hubble a hugely expensive laughing stock shortly after launch, but JPL scientists realized they could rescue the mission by installing corrective optics in an updated camera.

The orbiter will be the sixth spacecraft to explore the Jovian magnetosphere, but the first to be placed into orbit around the giant planet. Scientific objectives addressed by the orbiter are to: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n\nThe structure of the orbiter is divided into two sections. The main body of the spacecraft, comprised of the electronics bays, propellant system, RTG and science booms, and high-gain antenna, rotates at rates of 3.25 or 10.5 rpm. The despun section, aft of the main body, uses an electric motor to drive it counter to the rotation of the main section. This dual spin attitude control system accommodates instruments which require stable, accurate pointing (the imaging instruments) and those which benefit from repetitive, broad-angular coverage (the various particles and fields instruments). The length of the spacecraft is 9 m and, with the high-gain antenna (HGA) deployed, is 4.6 m in diameter.\n\nPower is provided to the spacecraft through the use of two radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs), each of which is located at the end of a short boom.

Juno was the first to fly over the north and south poles, a unique vantage point that accounts for many of the mission’s surprises.  Scientists discovered that the massive auroras undulating at Jupiter’s poles seem to form by different processes than the northern lights and southern lights on Earth. Investigators also discovered that lightning storms, which on Earth are more common near the equator, are a polar phenomenon on Jupiter, where they drop softball-sized hailstones of ammonia and water. A technical concern arose early in the mission, however – it changed Juno’s timeline, and altered what it would accomplish during its time in orbit.  Originally, the flight plan had Juno looping around Jupiter for a couple of 53-day orbits, then shrinking those orbits to 14 days for the remainder of the mission – spending about 15 months circling and studying the planet. But a problem in the main engine, with some valves not working as expected, troubled the Juno team; a misfire could prove disastrous. They decided to maintain the status quo of the longer orbits. Each flyby of Jupiter would give Juno’s instruments the same two-hour window to collect data, but they would come every seven weeks, instead of every two. The new plan meant a much longer schedule to complete Juno’s science goals. Then again, the wider orbits would allow for “bonus science” that wasn’t part of the original mission design.  The spacecraft could further explore the far reaches of space dominated by Jupiter’s magnetic field. And after it completed its initial goals, and NASA extended the mission, the Juno team realized that the long orbits would evolve to eventually put the planet’s Galilean moons within reach. On June 7, 2021, during orbit 34, Juno flew within 652 miles of Ganymede, Jupiter’s largest moon (in fact, the largest moon in the solar system). It was the closest such encounter since the Galileo spacecraft flew by Ganymede in May 2000.", "title": "Juno - NASA Science"}, {"document_id": "4a9dd1207fbb9a07-44845-46937", "source": "", "score": 15.824214, "text": "Juno - NASA Science\nThe Italian Space Agency provided a plaque depicting astronomer Galileo Galilei and handwritten text copied from his journal.

The scientific term for all these storms is tropical cyclone. Only tropical cyclones that form over the Atlantic Ocean or eastern Pacific Ocean are called \"hurricanes.\"\nWhatever they are called, tropical cyclones all form the same way.\n\nTropical cyclones are like giant engines that use warm, moist air as fuel. That is why they form only over warm ocean waters near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward from near the surface. Because this air moves up and away from the surface, there is less air left near the surface. Another way to say the same thing is that the warm air rises, causing an area of lower air pressure below.\n\nA cumulonimbus cloud. A tropical cyclone has so many of these, they form huge, circular bands.\n\nAir from surrounding areas with higher air pressure pushes in to the low pressure area. Then that \"new\" air becomes warm and moist and rises, too. As the warm air continues to rise, the surrounding air swirls in to take its place. As the warmed, moist air rises and cools off, the water in the air forms clouds.

There are four ways that cause air to rise in our atmosphere, which is necessary to initiate the formation of a cloud.\n1) Convection\nThis process starts when the Sun warms the surface of the Earth. The air right above the surface is warmer than the rest of the air and it starts to rise. If this portion or parcel of air rises enough to cool to the dew point, condensation occurs and a cloud forms. You see this most often on hot summer days when beautiful cumulus towers develop and grow.\nComparison Example: You may have experienced convection when you sat around a campfire, and felt the warmth of the heat coming from right above the fire.\n2) Convergence\nThis process happens when air at the surface comes together or converges and leads to air moving up. These clouds are not puffy cumulus like those seen through convection.\n3) Fronts\nWeather fronts, like a strong cold front, pushes air upward quite drastically and can produce strong cumulonimbus clouds that can lead to severe weather conditions. Different types of fronts lead to different lifting depending on the conditions. Dry lines* can also produce quite an amount of lifting that can lead to severe weather out in the Southwest.\n*Dry lines are similar to a cold or warm front, but instead of being a boundary separating different types of temperatures, it is a boundary separating dry air from moist air. They occur frequently in the Southwest United States (Texas and Oklahoma) when moist air from the Gulf of Mexico meets dry desert air from the Southwest.\n4) Topography\nLifting (or the movement of air upward) can also be caused by slopes and mountains. You may have seen how an area that is mostly flat can experience some clouds always around the one area that has some slope. Scientists call this process orographic lifting, meaning the movement of air influenced by mountains in that region.", "title": "Earth Matters"}, {"document_id": "de2c70091c5cd310-4253-4808", "source": "", "score": 9.836533, "text": "How Do Hurricanes Form? | NASA Space Place – NASA Science for Kids\nLess\n\nBy Subject\n\nSpace\nSun\nEarth\nSolar System\nPeople & Technology\nParents & Educators\n\nBy Type\n\nExplore\nDo\nPlay\n\nMore\nLess\n\nHurricane Katrina from space\n\nHere is a movie of Hurricane Katrina, which struck the coast of Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi on August 29, 2005, as a Category 3.

But how far? One of the most fundamental questions about the giant planet, scientists have debated that for decades. By measuring Jupiter’s gravity field, Juno discovered that the belts and zones – which are alternating east- and west-flowing jet streams – extend about 1,900 miles (3,000 kilometers) below the cloud tops.  Scientists long thought Jupiter had a small, solid core surrounded by all its hydrogen and helium. Juno data suggests the core is much larger than expected, yet partially dissolved, with no clear separation from the hydrogen swirling around it, leading researchers to describe the core as dilute, or “fuzzy.”  Under extreme pressure, gases can turn into their liquid form. Inside Jupiter the atmospheric pressure is so great, it compresses hydrogen gas not merely into liquid, but a fluid known as liquid metallic hydrogen. This exaggerated pressure makes the liquid hydrogen act like a metal conducting electricity, and scientists believe it’s the source of Jupiter’s uniquely intense magnetic field. Years of Juno measurements of Jupiter’s magnetic field point to that possibility, at a depth much shallower than expected.   Before Juno arrived, the largest planet in our solar system still had vast areas unexplored, unknown, even unseen.

And any molecules that might qualify as potential biosignatures, which include chemical signs of life, could be affected at that depth.\nThat’s because the impacts would churn some material to the surface, where radiation would likely break the bonds of any potential large, delicate molecules generated by biology. Meanwhile, some material on the surface would be pushed downward, where it could mix with the subsurface.\n“If we hope to find pristine, chemical biosignatures, we will have to look below the zone where impacts have been gardening,” said lead author Emily Costello, a planetary research scientist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. “Chemical biosignatures in areas shallower than that zone may have been exposed to destructive radiation.”\nGoing Deeper\nWhile impact gardening has long been understood to be likely taking place on Europa and other airless bodies in the solar system, the new modeling provides the most comprehensive picture yet of the process. In fact, it is the first to take into account secondary impacts caused by debris raining back down onto Europa’s surface after being kicked up by an initial impact. The research makes the case that Europa’s mid- to high-latitudes would be less affected by the double whammy of impact gardening and radiation.\n“This work broadens our understanding of the fundamental processes on surfaces across the solar system,” said Cynthia Phillips, a Europa scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and a co-author of the study. “If we want to understand the physical characteristics and how planets in general evolve, we need to understand the role impact gardening has in reshaping them.”\nManaged by JPL for NASA, Europa Clipper will help develop that understanding. The spacecraft, targeting a 2024 launch, will conduct a series of close flybys of Europa as it orbits Jupiter. It will carry instruments to thoroughly survey the moon, as well as sample the dust and gases that are kicked up above the surface.\nMore About the Mission", "title": "Surface of Jupiter's Moon Europa Churned by Small Impacts – NASA's Europa Clipper"}, {"document_id": "4a9dd1207fbb9a07-29825-32144", "source": "", "score": 11.957623, "text": "Juno - NASA Science\nPolar cyclones as large as Earth, plunging storm systems that travel deep into the heart of the gas giant, and a mammoth, lumpy magnetic field far more powerful than the strongest magnetic field found on Earth, all tantalized scientists. Previous spacecraft visiting Jupiter traveled more or less even with its equator – the same view of the planet that’s visible from Earth. Juno was the first to fly over the north and south poles, a unique vantage point that accounts for many of the mission’s surprises.  Scientists discovered that the massive auroras undulating at Jupiter’s poles seem to form by different processes than the northern lights and southern lights on Earth. Investigators also discovered that lightning storms, which on Earth are more common near the equator, are a polar phenomenon on Jupiter, where they drop softball-sized hailstones of ammonia and water. A technical concern arose early in the mission, however – it changed Juno’s timeline, and altered what it would accomplish during its time in orbit.  Originally, the flight plan had Juno looping around Jupiter for a couple of 53-day orbits, then shrinking those orbits to 14 days for the remainder of the mission – spending about 15 months circling and studying the planet. But a problem in the main engine, with some valves not working as expected, troubled the Juno team; a misfire could prove disastrous. They decided to maintain the status quo of the longer orbits. Each flyby of Jupiter would give Juno’s instruments the same two-hour window to collect data, but they would come every seven weeks, instead of every two. The new plan meant a much longer schedule to complete Juno’s science goals. Then again, the wider orbits would allow for “bonus science” that wasn’t part of the original mission design.  The spacecraft could further explore the far reaches of space dominated by Jupiter’s magnetic field. And after it completed its initial goals, and NASA extended the mission, the Juno team realized that the long orbits would evolve to eventually put the planet’s Galilean moons within reach. On June 7, 2021, during orbit 34, Juno flew within 652 miles of Ganymede, Jupiter’s largest moon (in fact, the largest moon in the solar system).

The spacecraft would orbit the giant planet about every two weeks, providing many opportunities for close flybys of Europa. The mission plan includes 45 flybys, during which the spacecraft would image the moon's icy surface at high resolution and investigate its composition and the structure of its interior and icy shell.\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, has been assigned the responsibility of managing the project. JPL has been studying the multiple-flyby mission concept, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, since 2011.\nInstruments selected for the Europa mission's scientific payload were announced by NASA on May 26. Institutions supplying instruments include APL; JPL; Arizona State University, Tempe; the University of Texas at Austin; Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio and the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n“It’s a great day for science,” said Joan Salute, Europa program executive at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “We are thrilled to pass the first major milestone in the lifecycle of a mission that will ultimately inform us on the habitability of Europa.”\nNASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington conducts a wide variety of research and scientific exploration programs for Earth studies, space weather, the solar system and the universe.\nFor more information about NASA's mission to Europa, visit:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/europa\n\nFeatured Resources\n\nU.S. Poet Laureate Ada Limón Meets NASA JPL Director Laurie Leshin\n\nU.S. Poet Laureate Ada Limón Visits Mission Control at NASA's JPL\n\nEuropa Clipper Vault Plate - Poem Close-Up\n\nMore resources ›\n\n[19]\n\nRelated News\n\nNASA has selected 40 undergraduate students for the first year of its Europa ICONS (Inspiring Clipper: Opportunities for Next-generation Scientists) internship program.\n\nNASA Selects Students for Europa Clipper Intern Program", "title": "All Systems Go for NASA's Mission to Jupiter Moon Europa – NASA's Europa Clipper"}, {"document_id": "0c52473c6e0a6eff-6360-8234", "source": "", "score": 18.420033, "text": "NASA's Europa Probe Gets a Hotline to Earth – NASA's Europa Clipper\nIt’s supercool to get to work on something that has the potential for such a big impact, in terms of knowledge, for humanity.”\nAfter completing this major milestone, Europa Clipper still has a few more steps and a few more tests ahead as it’s prepared for its trip to the outer solar system.\nMore About the Mission\nEuropa Clipper’s main science goal is to determine whether there are places below Jupiter’s icy moon, Europa, that could support life. The mission’s three main science objectives are to determine the thickness of the moon’s icy shell and its surface interactions with the ocean below, to investigate its composition, and to characterize its geology. The mission’s detailed exploration of Europa will help scientists better understand the astrobiological potential for habitable worlds beyond our planet.”\nNews Media Contacts\nGretchen McCartney \r\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \r\n818-393-6215\ngretchen.p.mccartney@jpl.nasa.gov \nKaren Fox / Alana Johnson\r\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\r\n301-286-6284 / 202-358-1501\nkaren.c.fox@nasa.gov / alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\nWritten by Pat Brennan\n\nLearn more\n\nActivities & Educational Resources\n\nAssembly\n\nEuropa Up Close\n\nRelated News\n\nMembers of the media put on “bunny suits” on April 11, 2024, to see Europa Clipper up close at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.\n\nMedia Get Close-Up of NASA's Jupiter-Bound Europa Clipper\n\nWe're thrilled to announce that NASA's 'Message in a Bottle' campaign has been nominated for a #Webby Award!

[Ballot]\nSeveral California cities—including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Jose—and some unincorporated communities have laws that limit how much landlords can increase rents for housing from one year to the next. These laws often are called rent control. About one-quarter of Californians live in communities with rent control. Local rent boards carry out rent control. These boards are paid for with fees on landlords.\nCourt Rulings Limit Local Rent Control. Courts have ruled that rent control laws must allow landlords to receive a “fair rate of return.” This means that landlords must be allowed to increase rents enough to receive some profit each year.\nState Law Limits Local Rent Control. A state law, known as the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act (Costa-Hawkins), limits local rent control laws. Costa-Hawkins creates three main limitations. First, rent control cannot apply to any single-family homes. Second, rent control cannot apply to any newly built housing completed on or after February 1, 1995. Third, rent control laws cannot tell landlords what they can charge a new renter when first moving in.\nState Law Limits Rent Increases. In addition to any local rent control laws in place as allowed by Costa-Hawkins, a more recent state law also limits rent increases for most rental housing in California. Landlords cannot increase rent by more than 5 percent plus inflation in a year, or 10 percent, whichever is lower. This applies to most housing that is more than 15 years old. This law lasts until January 1, 2030.\nState and Local Government Tax Revenues. Three taxes are the largest sources of tax revenue for the state and local governments in California—personal income tax, property tax, and sales tax. The state collects a personal income tax on income—including rent received by landlords—earned within the state. Local governments levy property taxes on property owners based on the value of their property. The state and local governments collect sales taxes on the retail sale of goods.\nProposal\nRepeals Costa-Hawkins. The measure repeals the limits on local rent control laws in Costa-Hawkins. Under the measure, cities and counties can regulate rents for any housing.", "title": "Local rent control laws.

The state and local governments collect sales taxes on the retail sale of goods.\nProposal\nRepeals Costa-Hawkins. The measure repeals the limits on local rent control laws in Costa-Hawkins. Under the measure, cities and counties can regulate rents for any housing. They also can limit how much a landlord may increase rents when a new renter moves in. The measure itself does not make any changes to existing local rent control laws. Generally, cities and counties would have to take separate actions to change their local laws. However, in some cases, existing provisions in local rent control laws that are currently inoperative because they are prohibited by Costa-Hawkins could become operative without further action at the local level. The measure does not affect the requirement that rent control laws must allow landlords to receive a fair rate of return.\nLimits State Authority to Regulate Rent Control. The measure specifies the state may not limit the right of cities and counties to maintain, enact, or expand rent control. However, the state still could set some minimum protections for renters, like the current statewide limit on rent increases.\nFiscal Effects\nEconomic Effects. If many local rent control laws automatically expand in response to the repeal of Costa-Hawkins and/or communities respond to this measure by further expanding their rent control laws beyond the existing protections for renters, it could lead to several economic effects. The most likely effects are:\n\nTo avoid rent regulation, some landlords would sell their rental housing to new owners who would live there.\nThe value of rental housing would decline because potential landlords would not want to pay as much for these properties.\nSome renters would spend less on rent and some landlords would receive less rental income.\nSome renters would move less often. For example, fewer renters would move because their rents increase.\n\nThe size of these effects would depend on how many communities pass new laws (or have existing rent control laws that could immediately become effective), and the type and scope of rent control adopted.", "title": "Local rent control laws.

[Ballot]\nThis would reduce expenses they can claim to lower their income tax payments (such as mortgage interest, property taxes, and depreciation). This would increase their income tax payments. The overall effect on state income tax revenue is not clear.\n\nOverall, the measure likely would reduce state and local revenues over time. The largest effect would be on property taxes. The amount of revenue loss would depend on many factors, most importantly how communities respond to this measure. For example, if communities that already have rent control expand their rules to include newer homes and single-family homes, revenue losses could be in the high tens of millions of dollars per year. If many communities create new rent control rules, revenue losses could be larger. If few communities make changes, revenue losses would be more limited and dependent on the scope of rent control laws that automatically expanded in response to the repeal of Costa-Hawkins.\nIncreased Local Government Costs. If cities or counties create new rent control laws or expand existing ones, local rent boards would have increased costs. For communities where rent control laws expand automatically, costs also could increase. Depending on local government choices, these costs could range from very little to tens of millions of dollars per year. These costs likely would be paid by fees on owners of rental housing.\nSummary of Fiscal Effects. We estimate that this measure would have the following major fiscal effect:\n\nOverall, a potential reduction in state and local revenues in the high tens of millions of dollars per year over time.

When seeking to construct, rehabilitate, or repair employee housing, the\r\nhousing owner must apply for a construction permit from the local building or health department and pay the corresponding fee for\r\nthe permit. There has been some concern that the development of housing could be delayed through the permit process by local\r\ncommunities resistant to employee housing. Specifically, an entity could prevent the housing by simply not acting on the permit\r\napplication in a timely manner and by not performing the necessary check of the submitted plans for consistency with the\r\nappropriate building and health codes.\nDepartment Given New Responsibility in 2000. In response to this concern, Chapter 702, Statutes of 2000 (SB 1545, Costa),\r\nprovides an alternative approval procedure for any employee housing application for agricultural workers that has not been either\r\napproved or denied by the local department within 60 days. In those instances, Chapter 702 gives HCD the authority to check the\r\npermit plans and approve the application, if appropriate. The owner can then proceed with the project as if it had received local\r\napproval.\nRequest for Funding. As a result of the new plan-checking responsibility, the budget proposes an ongoing General Fund\r\naugmentation of $50,000. The department proposes to use these funds to contract with the Department of General Services for the\r\nengineering services necessary to perform the plan checks. Since this is a new responsibility that depends on the actions of local\r\ngovernments, the department is unsure how many plan checks it will be required to perform. The requested funds would allow\r\nabout 350 plan checks to be performed annually.\nGeneral Fund Commitment Creates Wrong Incentives. We agree with Chapter 702's intent to prevent the unnecessary delay\r\nin the approval of farmworker housing projects. By granting the department's funding request, however, the state would create a\r\nfiscal incentive for some communities not to act on permit applications.

[Ballot]\nSeveral California cities—including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Jose—and some unincorporated communities have laws that limit how much landlords can increase rents for housing from one year to the next. These laws often are called rent control. About one-quarter of Californians live in communities with rent control. Local rent boards carry out rent control. These boards are paid for with fees on landlords.\nCourt Rulings Limit Local Rent Control. Courts have ruled that rent control laws must allow landlords to receive a “fair rate of return.” This means that landlords must be allowed to increase rents enough to receive some profit each year.\nState Law Limits Local Rent Control. A state law, known as the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act (Costa-Hawkins), limits local rent control laws. Costa-Hawkins creates three main limitations. First, rent control cannot apply to any single-family homes. Second, rent control cannot apply to any newly built housing completed on or after February 1, 1995. Third, rent control laws cannot tell landlords what they can charge a new renter when first moving in.\nState Law Limits Rent Increases. In addition to any local rent control laws in place as allowed by Costa-Hawkins, a more recent state law also limits rent increases for most rental housing in California. Landlords cannot increase rent by more than 5 percent plus inflation in a year, or 10 percent, whichever is lower. This applies to most housing that is more than 15 years old. This law lasts until January 1, 2030.\nState and Local Government Tax Revenues. Three taxes are the largest sources of tax revenue for the state and local governments in California—personal income tax, property tax, and sales tax. The state collects a personal income tax on income—including rent received by landlords—earned within the state. Local governments levy property taxes on property owners based on the value of their property.

Under the measure, cities and counties can regulate rents for any housing. They also can limit how much a landlord may increase rents when a new renter moves in. The measure itself does not make any changes to existing local rent control laws. Generally, cities and counties would have to take separate actions to change their local laws. However, in some cases, existing provisions in local rent control laws that are currently inoperative because they are prohibited by Costa-Hawkins could become operative without further action at the local level. The measure does not affect the requirement that rent control laws must allow landlords to receive a fair rate of return.\nLimits State Authority to Regulate Rent Control. The measure specifies the state may not limit the right of cities and counties to maintain, enact, or expand rent control. However, the state still could set some minimum protections for renters, like the current statewide limit on rent increases.\nFiscal Effects\nEconomic Effects. If many local rent control laws automatically expand in response to the repeal of Costa-Hawkins and/or communities respond to this measure by further expanding their rent control laws beyond the existing protections for renters, it could lead to several economic effects. The most likely effects are:\n\nTo avoid rent regulation, some landlords would sell their rental housing to new owners who would live there.\nThe value of rental housing would decline because potential landlords would not want to pay as much for these properties.\nSome renters would spend less on rent and some landlords would receive less rental income.\nSome renters would move less often.

The overall effect on state income tax revenue is not clear.\n\nOverall, the measure likely would reduce state and local revenues over time. The largest effect would be on property taxes. The amount of revenue loss would depend on many factors, most importantly how communities respond to this measure. For example, if communities that already have rent control expand their rules to include newer homes and single-family homes, revenue losses could be in the high tens of millions of dollars per year. If many communities create new rent control rules, revenue losses could be larger. If few communities make changes, revenue losses would be more limited and dependent on the scope of rent control laws that automatically expanded in response to the repeal of Costa-Hawkins.\nIncreased Local Government Costs. If cities or counties create new rent control laws or expand existing ones, local rent boards would have increased costs. For communities where rent control laws expand automatically, costs also could increase. Depending on local government choices, these costs could range from very little to tens of millions of dollars per year. These costs likely would be paid by fees on owners of rental housing.\nSummary of Fiscal Effects. We estimate that this measure would have the following major fiscal effect:\n\nOverall, a potential reduction in state and local revenues in the high tens of millions of dollars per year over time.

The\r\nbudget proposes total relief of $3.1 billion, of which almost $1.2 billion is appropriated in the budget bill.\nThe largest ongoing program appropriated in the budget bill is the homeowners' exemption. This provision, which is required by the State Constitution, grants a $7,000 property tax exemption\r\non the assessed value of owner-occupied dwellings, and requires the state to reimburse local governments for the resulting reduction in property tax revenues. The exemption reduces the typical\r\nhomeowner's taxes by about $75 annually. The Governor's budget proposes an expenditure of $417 million on this program in 2001-02. This is an increase of $8 million, or 2 percent, which\r\nreflects the expected growth in the number of homeowners claiming the exemption.\nVehicle License Fee Backfill \nThe largest program of tax relief pays for the costs of reimbursing local governments for reductions in the vehicle license fee (VLF). The VLF is an annual fee on the ownership of a registered\r\nvehicle in California, levied in place of taxing vehicles as personal property. The revenues are distributed to cities and counties. As part of the 1998 budget agreement, the VLF was permanently\r\ncut by 25 percent, with the potential of future reductions of up to 67.5 percent (dependent on the growth of General Fund revenues). For all VLF reductions, cities and counties continue to\r\nreceive the same amount of revenues as under prior law, with the reduced VLF amounts replaced by General Fund spending. This spending, known as the \"VLF backfill,\" is reflected in the tax\r\nrelief budget item.\nThe VLF Rebate Begins in 2001. As part of the 2000 budget agreement, vehicle owners will permanently receive the equivalent of a 67.5 percent reduction in the VLF beginning in calendar\r\nyear 2001.", "title": "2001 Budget Analysis: Tax Relief (9100)"}, {"document_id": "808b11da3d77018d-11090-13419", "source": "", "score": 13.720449, "text": "2001 Budget Analysis: California Housing Finance Agency (2260)\nOur review of these housing assistance programs indicates a number of concerns with their operation, which we discuss below.\nLack of Applications Threatens Viability of Programs. Without a dramatic expansion in home buyer and multifamily developer interest in the programs, the programs will continue to be an\r\nineffective effort to increase housing affordability. So far, CHFA has limited its marketing efforts primarily to the real estate industry, such as lenders, brokers, and real estate agents. The\r\ndepartment is now in the process of developing a marketing strategy aimed at the general public. The CHFA hopes that a greater awareness by the public of the programs will expand\r\napplications.\nWhile increased public awareness and the changes to the single-family programs implemented by Chapter 127 will increase their use somewhat in the future, the programs will be unlikely to\r\nexpend their total funding allocations by the programs' sunset date of December 31, 2002. In order to expend all of the program funds by the sunset, applications would need to grow by more\r\nthan 30 times over their current levels in the next two years.\nSimilar Home Buyers Treated Differently. Home buyers will typically pay for the local cost of their school facilities through a combination of developer fees, Mello-Roos bonds, and\r\nproperty tax overrides for general obligation bonds. Each of these financing mechanisms adds to the cost of housing, while providing revenues for local school facilities. The CHFA developer\r\nfee programs, however, only provide assistance for one type of these financing mechanisms. As a result, a home buyer who elects to buy a home in a school district using developer fees would\r\nbe eligible for state assistance. Another similar home buyer opting to purchase a home in a district using Mello-Roos bonds would not be eligible for any assistance. Similarly, purchasers of\r\nresale homes, including first-time home buyers, are not eligible for any assistance—even though they will likely bear the cost of school facility repair or reconstruction costs through some other\r\nfinancing means.\nBecause developer fees are not the sole method of taxing home buyers for the cost of school facilities, providing assistance based on the amount of developer fees paid excludes home buyers\r\ntaxed in the alternate ways.", "title": "2001 Budget Analysis: California Housing Finance Agency (2260)"}, {"document_id": "2059009a407fe8bb-43926-46141", "source": "", "score": 13.304628, "text": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) | Placer County, CA\nIn order to qualify for the exemption you must either:Own and occupy the dwelling as your principal residence as of January 1, each yearIntend to occupy, as your principal residence, a recently purchased or constructed dwelling within 90 days after the purchase or completion of constructionIf you qualify for this exemption under option number 2, the first year of the exemption will only apply to a Supplemental Assessment (if any).\n\nHow do I get a Homeowners' Exemption?\n\nYou may apply for a Homeowners' Exemption by submitting a claim form (e-file link) online.\n\nWhat is the filing period for the Homeowners' Exemption?\n\nThe deadline to file for the full exemption is February 15 of each year.

As more information about recent state efforts becomes available, we suggest the Legislature assess which types of interventions appear most effective. This information could help guide the state’s long‑term fiscal and policy role in addressing homelessness. \nFor Any Authorized Funds, Set Clear Expectations and Establish Metrics to Assess Performance. Setting clear expectations through statute and establishing reporting requirements to facilitate oversight over the state’s progress towards addressing homelessness will be critical. \n\nBackground\nHousing Affordability Affects Homelessness. The state is facing a severe affordable housing crisis. Not surprisingly, those living in poverty are the most significantly affected. Rising housing costs that have exceeded growth in wages, particularly for low‑income households, put Californians at risk of housing instability and homelessness. In California, around 2.5 million low‑income households are cost burdened (spend more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing). Over 1.5 million low‑income households face even more dire cost pressures—spending more than half of their income on housing. For this population, job loss or an unexpected expense could result in homelessness. \nHomelessness in California. While homelessness is a complex problem with many causes, the high costs of housing is a significant factor in the state’s homelessness crisis. More people experienced homelessness in California than any other state. As of January 2020—the most recent year complete federal data is available—California has about 161,500 individuals experiencing homelessness, which represents about 28 percent of the total homeless population in the nation. (California’s overall population, however, is about 12 percent of the nation.) Figure 1 provides additional details about people experiencing homelessness in California in 2020. Additionally, the state’s Homeless Data Integration System (HDIS)—which tracks people served in the state—identified that 246,100 unique people accessed some form of homelessness service in the state in 2020—159,400 individuals and 83,500 families with children. Included in the individual and family totals are 24,300 unaccompanied youth.

The state’s ability to spend the major proposed augmentation is unclear. Understanding how recently introduced legislation may expand the scope of allowable usages of the funds will be important. Additionally, the 2021‑22 funding was intended to fund demonstration projects which would inform best practices for addressing the needs of people living in unsheltered encampments, while simultaneously addressing the health and safety needs of the entire community.

We suggest the Legislature consider the trade‑offs between pursuing the bridge proposal, given the time and resources required to implement a new program of this scale and supporting existing services and programs.

While Figure 3 shows that the major recent augmentations span four departments and an even larger number of programs, the 2021‑22 budget actually provided even more funding—a total of $7.2 billion ($3.3 billion General Fund)—to about 30 homelessness‑related programs in additional state departments that are not all shown in the figure. Beyond the various state housing departments, the 2021‑22 budget also funds homelessness programs in the human services, health, veterans, transportation, higher education, and emergency services areas of the budget. We are only highlighting the implementation status of the major augmentations in this section. \nHomeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention Program (HHAPP)\nFlexible Aid to Local Entities. Since 2019‑20, the budget has authorized $2.95 billion General Fund in flexible aid to large cities (populations over 300,000), counties, Continuums of Care (CoCs)—local entities that administer housing assistance programs within a particular area, often a county or group of counties—and more recently to tribal governments through HHAPP to fund a variety of programs and services that address homelessness. Eligible uses include rapid rehousing, operating subsidies for existing supportive housing units, street outreach, service coordination, and permanent housing. Allocations to local entities generally are based on the local entity’s share of the homeless population. \nBudget‑related legislation has modified some HHAPP program features over time. Most significantly, the program has evolved to encourage coordination among local entities to address homelessness in their region and require local action plans that will facilitate assessing program performance and conducting oversight.", "title": "The 2022-23 Budget: The Governor’s Homelessness Plan"}, {"document_id": "3120ebe0fe3a911e-3565-5999", "source": "", "score": 13.017299, "text": "The 2022-23 Budget: The Governor’s Homelessness Plan\nAddressing this crisis requires a complex combination of services and infrastructure. As more information about recent state efforts becomes available, we suggest the Legislature assess which types of interventions appear most effective. This information could help guide the state’s long‑term fiscal and policy role in addressing homelessness. \nFor Any Authorized Funds, Set Clear Expectations and Establish Metrics to Assess Performance. Setting clear expectations through statute and establishing reporting requirements to facilitate oversight over the state’s progress towards addressing homelessness will be critical. \n\nBackground\nHousing Affordability Affects Homelessness. The state is facing a severe affordable housing crisis. Not surprisingly, those living in poverty are the most significantly affected. Rising housing costs that have exceeded growth in wages, particularly for low‑income households, put Californians at risk of housing instability and homelessness. In California, around 2.5 million low‑income households are cost burdened (spend more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing). Over 1.5 million low‑income households face even more dire cost pressures—spending more than half of their income on housing. For this population, job loss or an unexpected expense could result in homelessness. \nHomelessness in California. While homelessness is a complex problem with many causes, the high costs of housing is a significant factor in the state’s homelessness crisis. More people experienced homelessness in California than any other state. As of January 2020—the most recent year complete federal data is available—California has about 161,500 individuals experiencing homelessness, which represents about 28 percent of the total homeless population in the nation. (California’s overall population, however, is about 12 percent of the nation.) Figure 1 provides additional details about people experiencing homelessness in California in 2020. Additionally, the state’s Homeless Data Integration System (HDIS)—which tracks people served in the state—identified that 246,100 unique people accessed some form of homelessness service in the state in 2020—159,400 individuals and 83,500 families with children. Included in the individual and family totals are 24,300 unaccompanied youth. Finally, Figure 2 depicts how the state’s sheltered and unsheltered homeless populations have changed between 2010 and 2020.", "title": "The 2022-23 Budget: The Governor’s Homelessness Plan"}, {"document_id": "3120ebe0fe3a911e-45670-48089", "source": "", "score": 12.872694, "text": "The 2022-23 Budget: The Governor’s Homelessness Plan\nThe budget proposes $1 billion General Fund in 2022‑23 and $500 million General Fund in 2023‑24 to address the immediate housing and treatment needs of people with complex behavioral health conditions. The funding would be administered by DHCS through the Behavioral Health Continuum Infrastructure Program established in the 2021‑22 budget. While key details are forthcoming, the administration indicates funds could be used differently than the existing program structure. For instance, funds could be used to purchase and install tiny homes and to provide time‑limited operational supports in these tiny homes or in other housing settings, including existing assisted living settings. This funding is intended to serve as a “bridge” resource until the long‑term housing and treatment solutions for people with serious behavioral health conditions authorized as part of the 2021‑22 budget come online.\nEncampment Resolution Grants Program\nSignificantly Augments Funding for Encampment Resolution Program. The Governor proposes $500 million one‑time General Fund in 2022‑23 for the Encampment Resolution Grants Program administered by Cal ICH. This is a ten‑fold expansion of the current Encampment Resolution Grant Program. The program would require quarterly fiscal reports and annual programmatic outcomes reports from all funding recipients. Cal ICH anticipates collecting information emerging from the grantees across the state to identify, disseminate, and coordinate resources and services to prevent and end unsheltered homelessness in collaboration with other state agencies. Recently released budget‑related legislation provides additional details about how the proposal would be implemented. We are reviewing the proposed legislation. \nLAO Comments \nDevote Attention to Overseeing Recent Augmentations. We suggest the Legislature dedicate the early part of the budget process to overseeing the implementation of last year’s significant homelessness augmentations. In our examination of recent investments, described above, we have learned about the status of funding disbursements, when unawarded funds are anticipated to be released, and have an initial understanding about where resources are being allocated and for what purposes. However, there is more to learn as the Legislature conducts oversight of these programs, assesses their performance, and identifies opportunities to improve their operation.", "title": "The 2022-23 Budget: The Governor’s Homelessness Plan"}, {"document_id": "3120ebe0fe3a911e-53193-55642", "source": "", "score": 12.755616, "text": "The 2022-23 Budget: The Governor’s Homelessness Plan\nSpecifically, the Legislature could consider where existing programs could be leveraged to provide immediate housing support for people with behavioral health needs experiencing homelessness.

For example, could an expanded Project Roomkey address the immediate need identified by the Governor? Alternatively, would additional funding for CCE provide both immediate and longer‑term solutions? Some key questions to consider about the current proposal include: (1) what would happen to resources once permanent housing comes online, (2) how quickly can the bridge‑funded units be up and running, (3) how does the timing align with the anticipated schedule for more permanent options, (4) does the proposed bridge housing solution make sense for individuals with behavioral health conditions, and (5) how would the funding support transitioning individuals into permanent housing? Finally, the focus of the proposal—whether for behavioral health or broader homelessness‑related services—should determine which state entity should oversee the program. Currently, many state entities are tasked with different homelessness responsibilities, so ensuring programs are properly suited to a department’s mission is important.\nConclusion \nCalifornia has made notable progress in its engagement and development of partnerships with local governments since 2018‑19 when the state began taking a more active role in addressing homelessness. Overall, the state has increased its role in addressing homelessness by providing significant, albeit one‑time and temporary, funding towards infrastructure and flexible aid to local governments in recent years. Despite this progress, the scale of the homelessness crisis in California is significant and continued work and resources will be necessary to address the state’s homelessness challenges. We suggest the Legislature dedicate the early part of the budget process to overseeing the implementation of last year’s significant homelessness augmentations.

Russian communications satellites and the Sirius radio satellites currently use this type of orbit. (Adapted from Fundamentals of Space Systems by Vincent L. Pisacane, 2005.)\n\nThe Molniya orbit is highly eccentric: the satellite moves in an extreme ellipse with the Earth close to one edge. Because it is accelerated by our planet’s gravity, the satellite moves very quickly when it is close to the Earth. As it moves away, its speed slows, so it spends more time at the top of its orbit farthest from the Earth. A satellite in a Molniya orbit takes 12 hours to complete its orbit, but it spends about two-thirds of that time over one hemisphere. Like a semi-synchronous orbit, a satellite in the Molniya orbit passes over the same path every 24 hours. This type of orbit is useful for communications in the far north or south.\nLow Earth Orbit\nMost scientific satellites and many weather satellites are in a nearly circular, low Earth orbit. The satellite’s inclination depends on what the satellite was launched to monitor. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite was launched to monitor rainfall in the tropics. Therefore, it has a relatively low inclination (35 degrees), staying near the equator.\n\nTRMM’s low orbital inclination—just 35° from the equator—allows its instruments to concentrate on the tropics. This image shows one half of the observations TRMM makes in a single day. (NASA image courtesy TRMM Project.)\n\nMany of the satellites in NASA’s Earth Observing System have a nearly polar orbit. In this highly inclined orbit, the satellite moves around the Earth from pole to pole, taking about 99 minutes to complete an orbit. During one half of the orbit, the satellite views the daytime side of the Earth. At the pole, satellite crosses over to the nighttime side of Earth.\nAs the satellites orbit, the Earth turns underneath. By the time the satellite crosses back into daylight, it is over the region adjacent to the area seen in its last orbit.", "title": "Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits"}, {"document_id": "d430fcc6509467a4-19200-21462", "source": "", "score": 11.294272, "text": "Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits\nNow, the satellite is moving through this thicker layer of the atmosphere instead of the thin layer it was in when the Sun was less active. Since the satellite moves through denser air at solar maximum, it faces more resistance. When the Sun is quiet, satellites in low Earth orbit have to boost their orbits about four times per year to make up for atmospheric drag. When solar activity is at its greatest, a satellite may have to be maneuvered every 2-3 weeks.\nThe third reason to move a satellite is to avoid space junk, orbital debris, that may be in its path. On February 11, a communication satellite owned by Iridium, a U.S. company, collided with a non-functioning Russian satellite. Both satellites broke apart, creating a field of debris that contained at least 2,500 pieces. Each piece of debris was added to the database of more than 18,000 manmade objects currently in Earth orbit and tracked by the U.S. Space Surveillance Network.\nNASA satellite mission controllers carefully track anything that may enter the path of their satellites. As of May 2009, Earth Observing satellites had been moved three separate times to avoid orbital debris.\n\nThousands of manmade objects—95 % of them “space junk”— occupy low Earth orbit. Each black dot in this image shows either a functioning satellite, an inactive satellite, or a piece of debris. Although the space near Earth looks crowded, each dot is much larger than the satellite or debris it represents, and collisions are extremely rare. (NASA illustration courtesy Orbital Debris Program Office.)\n\nOrbiting objects are concentrated in low Earth orbit (nearly obscuring the Earth’s surface in this illustration) and geostationary orbit (revealed by the ring of satellites along the outer edges). (NASA illustration courtesy Orbital Debris Program Office.)\n\nThe debris field generated by the Iridium collision is of particular concern to the Earth Observing System because the center of the debris field will eventually drift through the EOS satellites’ orbits. The Iridium and Russian satellites were 790 kilometers above the Earth, while EOS satellites orbit at 705 kilometers. Many pieces of debris from this collision were propelled to lower altitudes and are already causing issues at 705 kilometers.", "title": "Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits"}, {"document_id": "a219ceb7178fd438-6127-8141", "source": "", "score": 11.189781, "text": "Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits\nThe perspectives of the Sun from 60 degrees behind (left) and ahead (right) of Earth’s orbit reveal portions of the Sun’s surface that would otherwise be hidden from view. (NASA images courtesy STEREO Science Center.)\n\nMedium Earth Orbit\nCloser to the Earth, satellites in a medium Earth orbit move more quickly. Two medium Earth orbits are notable: the semi-synchronous orbit and the Molniya orbit.\nThe semi-synchronous orbit is a near-circular orbit (low eccentricity) 26,560 kilometers from the center of the Earth (about 20,200 kilometers above the surface). A satellite at this height takes 12 hours to complete an orbit. As the satellite moves, the Earth rotates underneath it. In 24-hours, the satellite crosses over the same two spots on the equator every day. This orbit is consistent and highly predictable. It is the orbit used by the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites.\n\nThe second common medium Earth orbit is the Molniya orbit. Invented by the Russians, the Molniya orbit works well for observing high latitudes. A geostationary orbit is valuable for the constant view it provides, but satellites in a geostationary orbit are parked over the equator, so they don’t work well for far northern or southern locations, which are always on the edge of view for a geostationary satellite. The Molniya orbit offers a useful alternative.\n\nThe Molniya orbit combines high inclination (63.4°) with high eccentricity (0.722) to maximize viewing time over high latitudes. Each orbit lasts 12 hours, so the slow, high-altitude portion of the orbit repeats over the same location every day and night. Russian communications satellites and the Sirius radio satellites currently use this type of orbit. (Adapted from Fundamentals of Space Systems by Vincent L.

Many pieces of debris from this collision were propelled to lower altitudes and are already causing issues at 705 kilometers.\nMission control engineers track orbital debris and other orbiting satellites that could come into the Earth Observing System’s orbit, and they carefully plan avoidance maneuvers as needed. The same team also plans and executes maneuvers to adjust the satellite’s inclination and height. The team evaluates these planned maneuvers to ensure that they do not bring the EOS satellites into close proximity to catalogued orbital debris or other satellites.

If a satellite is at a height of 100 kilometers, it must have an orbital inclination of 96 degrees to maintain a Sun-synchronous orbit. Any deviation in height or inclination will take the satellite out of a Sun-synchronous orbit. Since the drag of the atmosphere and the tug of gravity from the Sun and Moon alter a satellite’s orbit, it takes regular adjustments to maintain a satellite in a Sun-synchronous orbit.\n\nAchieving and Maintaining Orbit\nLaunch\nThe amount of energy required to launch a satellite into orbit depends on the location of the launch site and how high and how inclined the orbit is. Satellites in high Earth orbit require the most energy to reach their destination. Satellites in a highly inclined orbit, such as a polar orbit, take more energy than a satellite that circles the Earth over the equator. A satellite with a low inclination can use the Earth’s rotation to help boost it into orbit. The International Space Station orbits at an inclination of 51.6397 degrees to make it easier for the Space Shuttle and Russian rockets to reach it. A polar-orbiting satellite, on the other hand, gets no help from Earth’s momentum, and so requires more energy to reach the same altitude.\n\nSatellites in low-inclination orbits can get an energy boost from the Earth’s rotation by being launched near the equator. The European Space Agency launches satellites into geostationary orbits from their facilities in French Guiana (left). On the other hand, high-inclination satellites don’t receive much benefit from equatorial launch sites. The Baikonur Cosmodrome (right), located at 49° north, is frequently used to launch satellites into polar and Molniya orbits, as well as to send astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.

This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.Orbit and RotationAs Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a leap year.Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, and the southern hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun higher in the sky, solar heating is greater in the north producing summer there. Less direct solar heating produces winter in the south. Six months later, the situation is reversed. When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres receive roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.MoonsEarth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar object in the night sky.

Many other solar systems have multiple suns, while ours just has one. Our Sun is 864,000 miles in diameter and 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit on the surface.\r\n\t\n\nCredit: ESA/NASA\n\nOur Sun is a bright, hot ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar system. It is 864,000 miles (1,392,000 km) in diameter, which makes it 109 times wider than Earth. It's 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius) at the surface, and 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15,000,000 degrees Celsius) in the core. Yikes!\nOur Sun is pretty impressive, but how does it compare to other stars? There are billions more stars in the Milky Way galaxy - the galaxy we call home. And there are many, many more in the rest of the universe. Is our Sun special?\n\nThe size of our sun\nIt turns out that our Sun is an average sized star. There are bigger stars, and there are smaller stars. We have found stars that are 100 times bigger in diameter than our sun. Truly, those stars are enormous. We have also seen stars that are just one tenth the size of our sun.\n\nSuns with friends\nOur Sun is a little unusual because it doesn't have any friends. It's just one Sun surrounded by planets, asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets. But solar systems can have more than one sun. In fact, that's often the case. More than half of all stars are in multiple star systems. That means the solar system has two or more suns in it.", "title": "How Does Our Sun Compare With Other Stars? | NASA Space Place – NASA Science for Kids", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "550486490ae28c75-1460-3583", "source": "", "score": 15.593783, "text": "Sun-Earth Days 2013: Articles\nThe sun is a moderate sized (1,400,000 km in diameter), G spectral type, variable star in a vast collection of an estimated 200-400 billion stars in a barred spiral galaxy called the Milky Way. Though it is a smallish star, most stars in our galaxy are smaller, and less massive. Our sun is, like most stars in our galaxy and probably most stars, a main sequence star which means it generates its energy by thermonuclear fusion resulting in the release of gamma ray photons during a process in the core where hydrogen nuclei (protons) are fused together to form helium nuclei. This process, converting hydrogen to helium, driven by the enormous internal pressure of the sun's mass (2x1030 kg or over 300,000 times the mass of the Earth!) is what makes a star a star. Since everything forms from a roughly basic and somewhat consistent cosmic menu of elements (75% H, 24% He,...) the variable that determines whether you get an asteroid, a planet, or a star is mass. Enough mass creates enough pressure to start this fusion process and create a star. Not enough mass and you have a failed star or planet (even less mass and you get an object that is not round at all). It's that simple. The sun formed around the same time that the planets formed, from a molecular cloud - remnant of a super nova explosion. The sun is very old, by human standards but only middle aged by stellar standards, about 4.6 billion years old and it should be around in a more or less similar form for maybe another 5 billion years.\nIt might be interesting to note that considering only classical (or Newtonian) physics, the physics that you learned in high school, the physics that defined reality for around 400 years, since Isaac Newton gave his three laws of motion, the sun and all the stars cannot shine. Classical physics does not allow two similarly charged protons to bond. In addition, matter - energy equivalency (E=mc2) was not known until the early 1900's. So before Einstein and before quantum physics, there was no plausible explanation for how the sun generated its energy. Want to know more?

But where is our solar system? It’s a small part of the Milky Way Galaxy.\nA galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems. A galaxy is held together by gravity. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, also has a supermassive black hole in the middle.\n\nWhen you look up at stars in the night sky, you’re seeing other stars in the Milky Way. If it’s really dark, far away from lights from cities and houses, you can even see the dusty bands of the Milky Way stretch across the sky.\n\nThe Milky Way galaxy fills the night sky in this photo. Credit: NPS/Dan Duriscoe\n\nThere are many galaxies besides ours, though. There are so many, we can’t even count them all yet! The Hubble Space Telescope looked at a small patch of space for 12 days and found 10,000 galaxies, of all sizes, shapes, and colors. Some scientists think there could be as many as one hundred billion galaxies in the universe.\n\nThis is a picture taken by the NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope showing thousands of galaxies.

Our Milky Way galaxy will someday bump into Andromeda, our closest galactic neighbor. But don’t worry. It won’t happen for about five billion years. But even if it happened tomorrow, you might not notice. Galaxies are so big and spread out at the ends that even though galaxies bump into each other, the planets and solar systems often don’t get close to colliding.\n\n \tarticle last updated July 13, 2022\n \n\nMore on Galaxies!\n\nMake a Pinwheel Galaxy pinwheel!\n\nWhat's a satellite galaxy?\n\nWhere'd all these galaxies come from?\n\nIf you liked this, you may like:\n\nTypes of Galaxies\n\nWhat Is the Big Bang?\n\nWhat Is a Satellite Galaxy?\n\n\t Games\t \n\n\t Crafts\t \n\n\t Activities\t \n\n\t Videos\t \n\n\t Glossary\t \n\n\t Mystery\t \n\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy\nImage Use\nAccessibility\n\nContact NASA Space Place\n\n Last Updated: May 6th, 2024 \n\n \n\nMore\nLess\n\nBy Subject\n\nSpace\nSun\nEarth\nSolar System\nPeople & Technology\nParents & Educators\n\nBy Type\n\nExplore\nDo\nPlay\n\nMore\nLess\n\nMore on Galaxies!\n\nMake a Pinwheel Galaxy pinwheel!\n\nWhat's a satellite galaxy?\n\nWhere'd all these galaxies come from?", "title": "What Is a Galaxy? | NASA Space Place – NASA Science for Kids"}, {"document_id": "7fa336e18f856eed-1066-3077", "source": "", "score": 16.543724, "text": "Galaxies - NASA Science\nTechnologyTechnology Living in SpaceManufacturing and MaterialsRoboticsScience InstrumentsComputingThe Universe ExoplanetsThe Search for Life in the UniverseStarsGalaxiesBlack HolesThe Big BangDark Matter &amp; Dark EnergyThe Solar System The SunMercuryVenusEarthThe MoonMarsJupiterSaturnUranusNeptunePluto &amp; Dwarf PlanetsAsteroids, Comets &amp; MeteorsThe Kuiper BeltThe Oort CloudSkywatchingEspañol CienciaAeronáuticaCiencias TerrestresSistema SolarUniversoScience All NASA ScienceEarth SciencePlanetary ScienceAstrophysics & Space ScienceThe Sun & HeliophysicsBiological & Physical SciencesLunar ScienceCitizen ScienceAstromaterialsAeronautics ResearchHuman Space Travel ResearchExploreSearchSubmitNews & EventsMultimediaNASA+UniverseCosmic HistoryBuilding BlocksForcesGalaxiesOverviewTypesEvolutionLarge Scale StructuresBlack HolesOverviewTypesAnatomyBlack Hole WeekStarsOverviewTypesMultiple Star SystemsPlanetary SystemsExoplanetsExplorationSensing the UniverseTelescopes 101ObservatoriesMoreNewsDeep DivesQuick ReadsMultimediaGlossaryExplore This SectionUniverseGalaxiesBlack HolesStarsExoplanetsExplorationMoreGalaxy BasicsGalaxies consist of stars, planets, and vast clouds of gas and dust, all bound together by gravity.

All galaxies are made up of these same things. However, they come in many different shapes and sizes.\n\nHere are a few types of galaxies:\n\nSpiral galaxies look like giant pinwheels. The arms of the pinwheel are made up of stars and lots of gas and dust. Gas and dust are some of the main ingredients needed to form new stars. Young stars burn much hotter than older stars, so spiral galaxies are often some of the brightest in the universe. About 60% of nearby galaxies are spirals. Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, is a very good example of one.\n\nElliptical galaxies are shaped like stretched-out circles, or ellipses. Some elliptical galaxies are more stretched out than others. One might look almost perfectly circular. Another one might look long and flat. Elliptical galaxies contain mostly older stars. That means they often aren't as bright as spiral galaxies. They also have very little dust and gas. Elliptical galaxies are the largest and most common galaxies observed. They make up about 20% of nearby galaxies.\n\nIrregular galaxies are just that: irregular. They don't have a single common shape. Irregular galaxies are among the smallest galaxies scientists have observed. However, they can also be very bright. Like spiral galaxies, irregular galaxies are often filled with gas, dust, and lots of bright young stars. About 20% of nearby galaxies are irregular galaxies.\n\nQuasars are compact areas in the center of a galaxy. They give off enormous amounts of energy. Quasars are actually some of the brightest objects in the universe. There are no quasars near our Milky Way.\n\n        \tarticle last updated January 19, 2022\n        \n\nExplore More!\n\nMake the Pinwheel Galaxy!\n\nWhat is a galaxy?\n\nWhat are black holes?\n\nIf you liked this, you may like:\n\nWhat Is a Galaxy?\n\nWhat Is the Big Bang?\n\nWhat Is a Satellite Galaxy?\n\n\t    Games\t    \n\n\t    Crafts\t    \n\n\t    Activities\t    \n\n\t    Videos\t    \n\n\t    Glossary\t    \n\n\t    Mystery\t    \n\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy\nImage Use\nAccessibility\n\nContact NASA Space Place\n\n        Last Updated: May 6th, 2024    \n\n \n\nMore\nLess\n\nBy Subject\n\nSpace\nSun\nEarth\nSolar System\nPeople & Technology\nParents & Educators\n\nBy Type\n\nExplore\nDo\nPlay\n\nMore\nLess\n\nExplore More!\n\nMake the Pinwheel Galaxy!\n\nWhat is a galaxy?\n\nWhat are black holes?\n\n \n\n", "title": "Types of Galaxies | NASA Space Place – NASA Science for Kids"}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "A galaxy is a massive collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars held together by gravity.

Hanna/NOAO/AURA/NSFOur Milky Way is one example of a broad class of galaxies defined by the presence of spiral arms. These galaxies resemble giant rotating pinwheels with a pancake-like disk of stars and a central bulge or tight concentration of stars.The spiral arms can be wound tightly or loosely, and some cannot be seen from Earth because we view the galaxy from the side, edge on.Spiral galaxies are surrounded by halos, mixtures of old stars, star clusters, and dark matter – invisible material that does not emit or reflect light but still has a gravitational pull on other matter. The youngest stars form in gas-rich arms, while older stars can be found throughout the disk and within the bulge and halo.Both the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies belong to a subtype known as barred spirals, which make up two-thirds of the group. Barred spirals sport ribbons of stars, gas, and dust that cut across their centers. Scientists think the presence of a bar indicates that a galaxy has reached full maturity.Elliptical GalaxiesNGC 2865, shown here in an image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, is an elliptical galaxy located 100 million light-years away.ESA/Hubble & NASAElliptical galaxies have shapes that range from completely round to oval. They are less common than spiral galaxies.Unlike spirals, elliptical galaxies usually contain little gas and dust and show very little organization or structure. The stars orbit around the core in random directions and are generally older than those in spiral galaxies since little of the gas needed to form new stars remains.", "title": "Types - NASA Science"}, {"document_id": "a74c19711dc17109-5566-8061", "source": "", "score": 17.592184, "text": "Types - NASA Science\nThey range from dwarf irregular galaxies with 100 million times the Sun’s mass to large ones weighing 10 billion solar masses.Astronomers think these galaxies’ odd shapes are sometimes the result of interactions with others. For example, one spiral galaxy passing another with a stronger gravitational pull could lose some of its material, become distorted, and morph into a new shape. Some, like gas-rich dwarf galaxies, may be new, formed by material pulled from such encounters. Or perhaps when galaxies collide, they create a larger, oddly shaped mashup. Some scientists theorize that some large irregular galaxies could represent an intermediate step between spiral and elliptical galaxies.Irregular galaxies born from galaxy interactions or collisions typically host a mix of older and younger stars, depending on the characteristics and composition of the original galaxies. Irregular galaxies may also hold significant amounts of gas and dust – essential ingredients for making new stars.Active GalaxiesAround 10% of known galaxies are active, which means their centers appear more than 100 times brighter than the combined light of their stars. They can be spiral, elliptical, or irregular. The Milky Way is not currently an active galaxy, although it likely experienced a burst of activity in the past few million years.Astronomers think this excess energy comes from areas near the galaxies’ central supermassive black holes, which range from hundreds of thousands to billions of times the mass of our Sun.Gas and dust collect around the black hole to form an accretion disk. The black hole’s gravity compresses and heats the disk, which causes the material to glow across multiple wavelengths, from infrared to X-rays.Infrared observations show that the black hole and its accretion disk are embedded within a clumpy ring of cooler dust, called a torus, that may be a few light-years across. Close to the black hole, a small fraction of the infalling gas can be driven outward, perpendicular to the disk, as jets of particles that move near the speed of light.During the early 20th century, astronomers began classifying active galaxies based on the distinctive characteristics and behaviors they observed. Scientists now think viewing the centers of these galaxies at different angles – for example, seeing directly into the torus versus seeing it from the side – produce many of the signature traits.Active galaxies can also be categorized by their brightness in radio wavelengths.", "title": "Types - NASA Science"}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "Not all galaxies contain black holes.

Anything with mass makes a dent in space-time, causing objects to be attracted to each other.Gravity is an attractive force that draws two objects together. Its strength approximately increases with the masses of the two objects but decreases with the square of the distance between them. That means that if the Moon were twice its current distance from Earth, the gravitational tug between the two would be just one fourth of what it is now.Despite being the weakest force, gravity works across infinite distances, making it responsible for the formation of the universe's structure.Electromagnetic ForceNASAOur television sets are powered by electromagnetism. Light carries this force, which illuminates our houses at night, keeps electrons in orbit around atomic nuclei, and allows chemical compounds to form.As the name implies, electromagnetism is the force that includes both electricity and magnetism. They are intertwined — a moving electric field produces a magnetic field, and vice versa.Like gravity, the strength of electromagnetism drops off with the square of the distance between objects and works at infinite range. However, electromagnetism only comes into play for charged objects, and whether it attracts or repels depends on the charges of each. Two negative or positive charges repel each other; one of each attracts.While electromagnetism is stronger than gravity, it is often balanced out in large objects by the equal numbers of positive and negative charges that form neutral atoms. For example, Earth has a magnetic field due to electric currents in its liquid core; however, Earth itself is electrically neutral.Strong Nuclear ForceNASANuclear forces affect our daily lives, but they work on distances smaller than atoms.The strong nuclear force, or strong force for short, holds together the building blocks of atoms.

But the past doesn’t go on forever.By measuring the speed of galaxies and their distances from us, scientists have found that if we could go back far enough, before galaxies formed or stars began fusing hydrogen into helium, things were so close together and hot that atoms couldn’t form and photons had nowhere to go. A bit farther back in time, everything was in the same spot. Or really the entire universe (not just the matter in it) was one spot.Don't spend too much time considering a mission to visit the spot where the universe was born, though, as a person cannot visit the place where the Big Bang happened. It's not that the universe was a dark, empty space and an explosion happened in it from which all matter sprang forth. The universe didn’t exist. Space didn’t exist. Time is part of the universe and so it didn’t exist. Time, too, began with the big bang. Space itself expanded from a single point to the enormous cosmos as the universe expanded over time.What is the universe made of?The universe contains all the energy and matter there is. Much of the observable matter in the universe takes the form of individual atoms of hydrogen, which is the simplest atomic element, made of only a proton and an electron (if the atom also contains a neutron, it is instead called deuterium). Two or more atoms sharing electrons is a molecule. Many trillions of atoms together is a dust particle. Smoosh a few tons of carbon, silica, oxygen, ice, and some metals together, and you have an asteroid. Or collect 333,000 Earth masses of hydrogen and helium together, and you have a Sun-like star.For the sake of practicality, humans categorize clumps of matter based on their attributes. Galaxies, star clusters, planets, dwarf planets, rogue planets, moons, rings, ringlets, comets, meteorites, raccoons — they’re all collections of matter exhibiting characteristics different from one another but obeying the same natural laws.Scientists have begun tallying those clumps of matter and the resulting numbers are pretty wild.", "title": "What is the Universe? - NASA Science", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "9e8c3d7955de76e6-5687-7792", "source": "", "score": 14.240313, "text": "What is the Universe? - NASA Science\nFor nearly two-thirds of the time since the universe began, Earth did not even exist. Nor will it last forever in its current state. Several billion years from now, the Sun will expand, swallowing Mercury and Venus, and filling Earth’s sky. It might even expand large enough to swallow Earth itself. It’s difficult to be certain. After all, humans have only just begun deciphering the cosmos.While the distant future is difficult to accurately predict, the distant past is slightly less so. By studying the radioactive decay of isotopes on Earth and in asteroids, scientists have learned that our planet and the solar system formed around 4.6 billion years ago.How old is the universe?The universe, on the other hand, appears to be about 13.8 billion years old. Scientists arrived at that number by measuring the ages of the oldest stars and the rate at which the universe expands. They also measured the expansion by observing the Doppler shift in light from galaxies, almost all of which are traveling away from us and from each other. The farther the galaxies are, the faster they’re traveling away. One might expect gravity to slow the galaxies’ motion from one another, but instead they’re speeding up and scientists don’t know why. In the distant future, the galaxies will be so far away that their light will not be visible from Earth.Put another way, the matter, energy and everything in the universe (including space itself) was more compact last Saturday than it is today.Put another way, the matter, energy and everything in the universe (including space itself) was more compact last Saturday than it is today.

This place is called the heliopause.

NASA, ESA, M.J. Jee and H. Ford (Johns Hopkins University)How has our view of the universe changed over time?Human understanding of what the universe is, how it works and how vast it is has changed over the ages. For countless lifetimes, humans had little or no means of understanding the universe. Our distant ancestors instead relied upon myth to explain the origins of everything. Because our ancestors themselves invented them, the myths reflect human concerns, hopes, aspirations or fears rather than the nature of reality.Several centuries ago, however, humans began to apply mathematics, writing and new investigative principles to the search for knowledge. Those principles were refined over time, as were scientific tools, eventually revealing hints about the nature of the universe. Only a few hundred years ago, when people began systematically investigating the nature of things, the word “scientist” didn’t even exist (researchers were instead called “natural philosophers” for a time). Since then, our knowledge of the universe has repeatedly leapt forward. It was only about a century ago that astronomers first observed galaxies beyond our own, and only a half-century has passed since humans first began sending spacecraft to other worlds.In the span of a single human lifetime, space probes have voyaged to the outer solar system and sent back the first up-close images of the four giant outermost planets and their countless moons; rovers wheeled along the surface on Mars for the first time; humans constructed a permanently crewed, Earth-orbiting space station; and the first large space telescopes delivered jaw-dropping views of more distant parts of the cosmos than ever before. In the early 21st century alone, astronomers discovered thousands of planets around other stars, detected gravitational waves for the first time and produced the first image of a black hole.Using the Event Horizon Telescope, scientists obtained an image of the black hole at the center of galaxy M87.Event Horizon Telescope collaboration et al.With ever-advancing technology and knowledge, and no shortage of imagination, humans continue to lay bare the secrets of the cosmos.

Humans haven’t even explored all the worlds in our own solar system. In short, most of the universe that can be known remains unknown.The universe is nearly 14 billion years old, our solar system is 4.6 billion years old, life on Earth has existed for maybe 3.8 billion years, and humans have been around for only a few hundred thousand years. In other words, the universe has existed roughly 56,000 times longer than our species has. By that measure, almost everything that’s ever happened did so before humans existed. So of course we have loads of questions — in a cosmic sense, we just got here.Our first few decades of exploring our own solar system are merely a beginning. From here, just one human lifetime from now, our understanding of the universe and our place in it will have undoubtedly grown and evolved in ways we can today only imagine.Next: The Search for Life: Are We Alone?Return to topThe National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.About NASA's MissionJoin UsHomeNews & EventsMultimediaNASA+MissionsHumans in SpaceEarth & ClimateThe Solar SystemThe UniverseScienceAeronauticsTechnologyLearning ResourcesAbout NASANASA en EspañolFollow NASAMore NASA Social AccountsNASA NewslettersSitemapFor MediaPrivacy PolicyFOIANo FEAR ActOffice of the IGBudget & Annual ReportsAgency Financial ReportsContact NASAAccessibilityPage Last Updated:last monthPage Editor:SMD Content EditorsResponsible NASA Official for Science:Dana Bolles", "title": "What is the Universe? - NASA Science"}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "The Big Bang is how astronomers explain the beginning of the universe.

But sea level does not rise evenly; it piles up more in some places because of natural wind and current patterns. And turbulence matters. Imagine a bathtub with a child sloshing around in it. Waves can roll up one side and then the other, sometimes splashing over the brim. The higher the flat-water line (sea level), the greater the chance that the water will slosh out of the basin when it is stirred up by storms and winds.\nSea level also matters in a horizontal direction. A rule of thumb is that 1 inch of vertical change in sea level translates into 100 inches of horizontal loss on a flat beach or marsh. In this way, a little bit of sea level rise can translate into a lot of water moving inland when there are storms or abnormally high tides. “Sea level is important because it gradually moves the high-tide line farther up the beach and closer to buildable land,” said John Jaeger, a coastal geologist from the University of Florida. “It also allows storm surges to penetrate farther inland.”\n\nJanuary 28, 2015JPEG\n\nThe high-tide line has been moving landward for some time at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida.

Given the large changes we are seeing in the ice sheets today, that is not likely.”\nRising concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere increase the temperature of air and water, which causes sea level to rise in two ways. First, warmer water expands, and this “thermal expansion” of the ocean has contributed about half of the 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) of global mean sea level rise that has been observed over the past 25 years, Nerem said. Second, the water from melting land ice flows into the ocean, which also increases sea level around the world.\nThe rate of sea level rise has risen from about 2.5 millimeters (0.1 inch) per year in the 1990s to about 3.4 millimeters (0.13 inches) per year today. These increases have been measured by satellite altimeters since 1992, including the TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, and Jason-3 missions, which have been jointly managed by NASA, France’s Centre national d'etudes spatiales (CNES), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

This acceleration has been driven mainly by increased ice melting in Greenland and Antarctica, and it has the potential to double the total sea level rise projected by 2100, according to lead author Steve Nerem, a scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and the University of Colorado.\nIf things continue to change at the observed pace, sea level will rise 65 centimeters (26 inches) by 2100, enough to cause significant problems for coastal cities. The team—comprised of scientists from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, the University of Colorado, the University of South Florida, and Old Dominion University—recently published their work in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n“This is almost certainly a conservative estimate,” said Nerem, who is a member of NASA’s Sea Level Change team. “Our extrapolation assumes that sea level continues to change in the future as it has over the last 25 years. Given the large changes we are seeing in the ice sheets today, that is not likely.”\nRising concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere increase the temperature of air and water, which causes sea level to rise in two ways.", "title": "Sea Level Rise is Accelerating", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "5306392549c81595-29846-31923", "source": "", "score": 14.911328, "text": "Global Warming\nWith some exceptions, the tropics will likely receive less rain (orange) as the planet warms, while the polar regions will receive more precipitation (green). White areas indicate that fewer than two-thirds of the climate models agreed on how precipitation will change. Stippled areas reveal where more than 90 percent of the models agreed. (©2007 IPCC WG1 AR-4.)\n\nIt is impossible to pin any single unusual weather event on global warming, but emerging evidence suggests that global warming is already influencing the weather. Heat waves, droughts, and intense rain events have increased in frequency during the last 50 years, and human-induced global warming more likely than not contributed to the trend.\nRising Sea Levels\nThe weather isn’t the only thing global warming will impact: rising sea levels will erode coasts and cause more frequent coastal flooding. Some island nations will disappear. The problem is serious because up to 10 percent of the world’s population lives in vulnerable areas less than 10 meters (about 30 feet) above sea level.\nBetween 1870 and 2000, the sea level increased by 1.7 millimeters per year on average, for a total sea level rise of 221 millimeters (0.7 feet or 8.7 inches). And the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. Since 1993, NASA satellites have shown that sea levels are rising more quickly, about 3 millimeters per year, for a total sea level rise of 48 millimeters (0.16 feet or 1.89 inches) between 1993 and 2009.\n\nSea levels crept up about 20 centimeters (7.9 inches) during the twentieth century. Sea levels are predicted to go up between 18 and 59 cm (7.1 and 23 inches) over the next century, though the increase could be greater if ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica melt more quickly than predicted. Higher sea levels will erode coastlines and cause more frequent flooding.

Given the large changes we are seeing in the ice sheets today, that is not likely.”\nRising concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere increase the temperature of air and water, which causes sea level to rise in two ways. First, warmer water expands, and this “thermal expansion” of the ocean has contributed about half of the 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) of global mean sea level rise that has been observed over the past 25 years, Nerem said. Second, the water from melting land ice flows into the ocean, which also increases sea level around the world.\nThe rate of sea level rise has risen from about 2.5 millimeters (0.1 inch) per year in the 1990s to about 3.4 millimeters (0.13 inches) per year today. These increases have been measured by satellite altimeters since 1992, including the TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, and Jason-3 missions, which have been jointly managed by NASA, France’s Centre national d'etudes spatiales (CNES), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Climate is influenced by the movement of heat and moisture by air and ocean currents, which can affect the temperatures, precipitation, humidity, soil moisture, surface water levels, groundwater levels, and even storm events of a particular region.Climate change refers to long-term changes in the average weather patterns that define the Earth's global, regional and local climates. Often when we think of climate change, we think of the physical effects of climate change such as heatwaves, sea level rise, and heavy rainfall, and the impacts on communities and the environment, such as floods and droughts.Some climate change is influenced by naturally occurring changes in the Earth's temperature. For at least the last million years, the Earth has experienced natural cycles of cooling and warming, taking the Earth into ice ages and warming it up again. Each of these naturally-occurring cycles has taken approximately 100,000 years to complete.However, today's climate is changing much more rapidly because of greenhouse gas emissions released from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, wetland loss, and other human activities that are causing the Earth's average temperature to heat up much faster than it would naturally.The Greenhouse Effect, Greenhouse Gases, and Global Warming\n\n \n\nEnergy from the sun, or solar radiation, travels through space and enters the Earth's atmosphere, which forms a kind of warm blanket around the Earth. Some solar radiation remains trapped in the atmosphere under this blanket and is absorbed by land, air, and surface waters, while some solar radiation is reflected by land, ice, or clouds and escapes back out into space. When the Earth reflects the same amount of energy as it absorbs, the balance keeps the planet's average temperature fairly stable. This is called the greenhouse effect, and is essential for sustaining life on Earth. The revolution of the Earth around the sun and the tilt of the Earth on its axis create variation in the intensity of solar radiation received by different sections of the planet and drive naturally occurring cycles of planetary cooling and warming.

Increased warming of the Earth's oceans and the atmosphere is driving climate change by affecting the way heat and moisture are moved through the climate system by air and ocean currents, changing patterns of precipitation, temperatures, storms, and even sea level all around the globe.Ocean WarmingOceans cover 70% of the Earth's surface and can absorb large amounts of solar energy. Heat and moisture are moved by ocean currents and atmospheric circulation, influencing the climate around the planet.The oceans have a large capacity for absorbing and holding heat. For decades, the oceans have taken up more than 90% of excess heat from the atmosphere. If not for the ability of Earth's oceans to absorb such large amounts of heat, the atmosphere would warm at a much faster rate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 6th Assessment Report (AR6) finds that the rate of ocean warming observed since 1971 will at least double by the year 2100, even if GHG emissions are reduced. Ocean temperature plays an important role in the Earth's climate system, particularly sea surface temperature (SST). SST has risen as oceans absorb more heat from the atmosphere, resulting in changes to ocean currents and circulation, as well as sea level rise. SST has a significant impact on climate. As SST rises, increased evaporation leads to a greater concentration of water vapor over the oceans, influencing weather systems that produce precipitation or contribute to drought conditions.", "title": "Climate Change - NYSDEC", "reference": true}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "Climate change is not fake.

Climate is influenced by the movement of heat and moisture by air and ocean currents, which can affect the temperatures, precipitation, humidity, soil moisture, surface water levels, groundwater levels, and even storm events of a particular region.Climate change refers to long-term changes in the average weather patterns that define the Earth's global, regional and local climates. Often when we think of climate change, we think of the physical effects of climate change such as heatwaves, sea level rise, and heavy rainfall, and the impacts on communities and the environment, such as floods and droughts.Some climate change is influenced by naturally occurring changes in the Earth's temperature. For at least the last million years, the Earth has experienced natural cycles of cooling and warming, taking the Earth into ice ages and warming it up again. Each of these naturally-occurring cycles has taken approximately 100,000 years to complete.However, today's climate is changing much more rapidly because of greenhouse gas emissions released from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, wetland loss, and other human activities that are causing the Earth's average temperature to heat up much faster than it would naturally.The Greenhouse Effect, Greenhouse Gases, and Global Warming\n\n \n\nEnergy from the sun, or solar radiation, travels through space and enters the Earth's atmosphere, which forms a kind of warm blanket around the Earth. Some solar radiation remains trapped in the atmosphere under this blanket and is absorbed by land, air, and surface waters, while some solar radiation is reflected by land, ice, or clouds and escapes back out into space. When the Earth reflects the same amount of energy as it absorbs, the balance keeps the planet's average temperature fairly stable. This is called the greenhouse effect, and is essential for sustaining life on Earth. The revolution of the Earth around the sun and the tilt of the Earth on its axis create variation in the intensity of solar radiation received by different sections of the planet and drive naturally occurring cycles of planetary cooling and warming. This variation over time is what sends the Earth into ice ages and then into shorter warming periods between these ice ages.", "title": "Climate Change - NYSDEC"}, {"document_id": "aecf3ba8a6f472c2-4204-6628", "source": "", "score": 10.102376, "text": "Climate Change - NASA Science\nThis increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2.

Intense droughts can lead to an increase in malnutrition. On a longer time scale, fresh water will become scarcer, especially during the summer, as mountain glaciers disappear, particularly in Asia and parts of North America.\nOn the flip side, there could be “winners” in a few places. For example, as long as the rise in global average temperature stays below 3 degrees Celsius, some models predict that global food production could increase because of the longer growing season at mid- to high-latitudes, provided adequate water resources are available. The same small change in temperature, however, would reduce food production at lower latitudes, where many countries already face food shortages. On balance, most research suggests that the negative impacts of a changing climate far outweigh the positive impacts. Current civilization—agriculture and population distribution—has developed based on the current climate. The more the climate changes, and the more rapidly it changes, the greater the cost of adaptation.\nUltimately, global warming will impact life on Earth in many ways, but the extent of the change is largely up to us. Scientists have shown that human emissions of greenhouse gases are pushing global temperatures up, and many aspects of climate are responding to the warming in the way that scientists predicted they would. This offers hope. Since people are causing global warming, people can mitigate global warming, if they act in time. Greenhouse gases are long-lived, so the planet will continue to warm and changes will continue to happen far into the future, but the degree to which global warming changes life on Earth depends on our decisions now.\n\nReferences\nAnthes, R.A., Corell, R.W., Holland, G., Hurrell, J.W., MacCracken, M.C., & Trenberth, K.

For example, as long as the rise in global average temperature stays below 3 degrees Celsius, some models predict that global food production could increase because of the longer growing season at mid- to high-latitudes, provided adequate water resources are available. The same small change in temperature, however, would reduce food production at lower latitudes, where many countries already face food shortages. On balance, most research suggests that the negative impacts of a changing climate far outweigh the positive impacts. Current civilization—agriculture and population distribution—has developed based on the current climate. The more the climate changes, and the more rapidly it changes, the greater the cost of adaptation.\nUltimately, global warming will impact life on Earth in many ways, but the extent of the change is largely up to us. Scientists have shown that human emissions of greenhouse gases are pushing global temperatures up, and many aspects of climate are responding to the warming in the way that scientists predicted they would. This offers hope. Since people are causing global warming, people can mitigate global warming, if they act in time. Greenhouse gases are long-lived, so the planet will continue to warm and changes will continue to happen far into the future, but the degree to which global warming changes life on Earth depends on our decisions now.\n\nReferences\nAnthes, R.A., Corell, R.W., Holland, G., Hurrell, J.W., MacCracken, M.C., & Trenberth, K.

The potential adverse impacts of global warming include the exacerbation of air quality problems, a reduction in the quality and supply of water to the state from the Sierra snowpack, a rise in sea levels resulting in the displacement of thousands of coastal businesses and residences, damage to marine ecosystems and the natural environment, and an increase in the incidences of infectious diseases, asthma, and other human health-related problems.(b) Global warming will have detrimental effects on some of\n\t California’s largest industries, including agriculture, wine, tourism, skiing, recreational and commercial fishing, and forestry. It will also increase the strain on electricity supplies necessary to meet the demand for summer air-conditioning in the hottest parts of the state.(c) California has long been a national and international leader on energy conservation and environmental stewardship efforts, including the areas of air quality protections, energy efficiency requirements, renewable energy standards, natural resource conservation, and greenhouse gas emission standards for passenger vehicles. The program established by this division will continue this tradition of environmental leadership by placing California at the forefront of national and international efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.(d) National and international actions are necessary to fully address\n\t the issue of global warming. However, action taken by California to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases will have far-reaching effects by encouraging other states, the federal government, and other countries to act.(e) By exercising a global leadership role, California will also position its economy, technology centers, financial institutions, and businesses to benefit from national and international efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. More importantly, investing in the development of innovative and pioneering technologies will assist California in achieving the 2020 statewide limit on emissions of greenhouse gases established by this division and will provide an opportunity for the state to take a global economic and technological leadership role in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.(f) It is the intent of the Legislature that the State Air Resources Board\n\t coordinate with state agencies, as well as consult with the environmental justice community, industry sectors, business groups, academic institutions, environmental organizations, and other stakeholders in implementing this division.", "title": "Bill Text - AB-32 Air pollution: greenhouse gases: California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006."}, {"document_id": "5306392549c81595-5-1875", "source": "", "score": 8.842629, "text": "Global Warming\nGlobal Warming\n\nAtmosphere\nHeat\nHuman Presence\nLand\nLife\n\nNatural\n Events\n\nAll\nDrought\nDust and Haze\nEarthquakes\nFires\nFloods\nLandslides\nMan-made\nSea and Lake Ice\nSevere Storms\nTemperature Extremes\nUnique Imagery\nVolcanoes\nWater Color\n\nRemote Sensing\nSnow & Ice\nWater\n\nCollections\n\nABCs from Space\nAir Quality\nAmazon Deforestation\nApplied Sciences\nAstronaut Photography\nBackgrounders\nBlue Marble\nEarth at Night\nEarth from Afar\nFall Colors\nFood and Agriculture\nInternational Parks and UNESCO Sites\nRenewable and Alternative Energy\nSea Level Rise\nU.S. National Parks\nWorld of Change\n\nEO Explorer\n\nTopics\n\nSearch\n\nImages\nGlobal Maps\nArticles\nBlogs\nEO Explorer\n\n×\n This page contains archived content and is no longer being updated.

We know this because scientists closely monitor the natural and human activities that influence climate with a fleet of satellites and surface instruments.\n\nRemote meteorological stations (left) and orbiting satellites (right) help scientists monitor the causes and effects of global warming. [Images courtesy NOAA Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (left) and Environmental Visualization Laboratory (right).]\n\nNASA satellites record a host of vital signs including atmospheric aerosols (particles from both natural sources and human activities, such as factories, fires, deserts, and erupting volcanoes), atmospheric gases (including greenhouse gases), energy radiated from Earth’s surface and the Sun, ocean surface temperature changes, global sea level, the extent of ice sheets, glaciers and sea ice, plant growth, rainfall, cloud structure, and more.\nOn the ground, many agencies and nations support networks of weather and climate-monitoring stations that maintain temperature, rainfall, and snow depth records, and buoys that measure surface water and deep ocean temperatures. Taken together, these measurements provide an ever-improving record of both natural events and human activity for the past 150 years.\nScientists integrate these measurements into climate models to recreate temperatures recorded over the past 150 years. Climate model simulations that consider only natural solar variability and volcanic aerosols since 1750—omitting observed increases in greenhouse gases—are able to fit the observations of global temperatures only up until about 1950. After that point, the decadal trend in global surface warming cannot be explained without including the contribution of the greenhouse gases added by humans.\nThough people have had the largest impact on our climate since 1950, natural changes to Earth’s climate have also occurred in recent times. For example, two major volcanic eruptions, El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991, pumped sulfur dioxide gas high into the atmosphere.

The gas was converted into tiny particles that lingered for more than a year, reflecting sunlight and shading Earth’s surface. Temperatures across the globe dipped for two to three years.\n\nAlthough Earth’s temperature fluctuates naturally, human influence on climate has eclipsed the magnitude of natural temperature changes over the past 120 years. Natural influences on temperature—El Niño, solar variability, and volcanic aerosols—have varied approximately plus and minus 0.2° C (0.4° F), (averaging to about zero), while human influences have contributed roughly 0.8° C (1° F) of warming since 1889. (Graphs adapted from Lean et al., 2008.)\n\nAlthough volcanoes are active around the world, and continue to emit carbon dioxide as they did in the past, the amount of carbon dioxide they release is extremely small compared to human emissions. On average, volcanoes emit between 130 and 230 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. By burning fossil fuels, people release in excess of 100 times more, about 26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere every year (as of 2005). As a result, human activity overshadows any contribution volcanoes may have made to recent global warming.\nChanges in the brightness of the Sun can influence the climate from decade to decade, but an increase in solar output falls short as an explanation for recent warming. NASA satellites have been measuring the Sun’s output since 1978. The total energy the Sun radiates varies over an 11-year cycle. During solar maxima, solar energy is approximately 0.1 percent higher on average than it is during solar minima.\n\nThe transparent halo known as the solar corona changes between solar maximum (left) and solar minimum (right).

I have focused on the multispectral thermal IR data of ASTER in order to map composition and micron-scale roughness of volcanic surfaces. No other sensor can capture this information, which is important to a better understanding of the activity conditions present at active lava domes and flows.\nWhy is the study of volcanoes important?\nMR: Although volcanoes do not kill as many people as earthquakes or large tropical storms (more than 70,000 deaths from volcanic eruptions occurred last century compared to more than that in just one large earthquake), there are several important reasons to study them. The first is hazard mitigation – over a half a billion people live directly in harms way of typical volcanic activity. This number grows significantly when one considers the much larger (but more rare) eruptions that have happened over time. The second reason is that volcanism is a primary geologic process that has operated throughout most of the Earth’s history (along with impact cratering). For a geologist, studying volcanoes can lead to important insights into the solid Earth processes that have operated over geologic time and are ongoing at depth under every active volcano.\nWhat are some effects of volcanic eruptions on the global climate?\nMR: I do not study the climate aspects of volcanic eruptions directly since I am more interested in the geology. However volcanoes can produce large amounts of carbon dioxide, water, and sulfur dioxide as well as ash.  The first two are major greenhouse gases, which can impact climate change. Volcanic ash can cause major disruptions to air traffic (as was seen in Iceland in 2010), can render lands around the volcano unusable for decades, be a major irritant to human health, and can cause structures to fail due to the weight of the ash.\nVolcano eruptions disperse gas, liquids, and particles into the lower atmosphere.  One of the expellants is sulfur dioxide (SO2.)  What are the effects on the environment?", "title": "April | 2012 | Terra", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "9d9077fa5c8c029d-10991-12743", "source": "", "score": 12.138234, "text": "8263 Search Results for \"Climate Change\"\nrelationship between volcanoes and climate change....Graphic: Volcanoes and Climate Change March 31, 2023 Credit Photo by DIEGO...\t\n\n\t2 Min Read\t\nIs Climate Change the Same as Global Warming - We Asked a NASA Scientist: Episode 46 - NASA\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/earth/climate-change/is-climate-change-the-same-as-global-warming-we-asked-a-nasa-scientist-episode-46\n\n\tIs climate change the same as global warming?...2 min read Is Climate Change the Same as Global Warming – We Asked a NASA Scientist:...Furfaro Aug...\t\n\n\t6 Min Read\t\nSpace Station Studies Help Monitor Climate Change - NASA\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/missions/station/iss-research/space-station-studies-help-monitor-climate-change\n\n\tprovides 3 platforms to study climate change: exterior Earth-observing instruments...Space Station Studies Help Monitor Climate Change Melissa L....\t\n\nWhat’s the difference between climate change and global warming? - NASA Science\n\n\thttps://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/faq/whats-the-difference-between-climate-change-and-global-warming\t\n\n\tThe terms “global warming” and “climate change” are sometimes used interchangeably...warming” is only one aspect of climate change. “Global...\t\n\n\t2 Min Read\t\nNew U.N. report: Humans responsible for climate change - NASA Science\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/earth/climate-change/new-un-report-humans-responsible-for-climate-change\n\n\tof climate change.

Stay healthy this summer. Take steps to avoid mosquito bites, especially in from evening to morning when the mosquitoes that spread West Nile virus are most active.How many people get sick with West Nile virus?Nearly 44,000 cases of West Nile virus disease (West Nile virus) have been reported in the United States since 1999. Of those, over 20,000 people have had infections of the brain or spinal cord and more than 1,900 people have died.

It is caused by a misfolded form of a normal protein, known as a prion. The misfolded proteins aggregate in tissues, particularly the brain, causing progressive damage. CWD belongs to a group of human and animal diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). Examples of TSEs in animals include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, also known as “mad cow disease,” and scrapie in sheep and goats, which has been known to veterinary medicine for over 200 years. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a sporadic prion disease arising in 1:1,000,000 people, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which has been linked to the consumption of infected cattle during the “mad cow disease” outbreak in Great Britain and Europe in the 1990s, are examples of TSEs in humans.\n\nHow is chronic wasting disease spread?\n\nThe misfolded prion that causes CWD is infectious to other cervids and can be spread through direct contact with infected individuals or through contact with a contaminated environment.", "title": "\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n"}, {"document_id": "dd2c94212064f84d-2896-5084", "source": "", "score": 16.64507, "text": "\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a sporadic prion disease arising in 1:1,000,000 people, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which has been linked to the consumption of infected cattle during the “mad cow disease” outbreak in Great Britain and Europe in the 1990s, are examples of TSEs in humans.\n\nHow is chronic wasting disease spread?\n\nThe misfolded prion that causes CWD is infectious to other cervids and can be spread through direct contact with infected individuals or through contact with a contaminated environment. Infectious prions can be excreted in urine, feces, and saliva of infected animals, even before they show any signs of the disease. Carcasses and tissues, especially brain, spinal cord, and lymph nodes, of infected animals contain infectious prions and may spread the disease if left out on the landscape. Prions are very stable and difficult to disinfect, persisting for years in a contaminated environment able to infect a susceptible deer or elk.\n\nWhere is chronic wasting disease?\n\nChronic wasting disease (CWD) was first described in mule deer at a captive facility in Colorado in 1967. Since then, CWD has been diagnosed in free-ranging deer, elk, and moose populations in 34 states (now including California) and four Canadian provinces. It has also been found in captive elk and Sika deer in South Korea, free-ranging moose and reindeer in Norway, and free-ranging moose in Finland. For a map of current known CWD infected populations in North America, please visit the United States Geological Survey (USGS) CWD page. A timeline of the spread of CWD can be found by visiting the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance website.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic wasting disease?\n\nThe progression of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in an infected animal is very slow. It takes months or even years following infection for clinical signs of CWD to appear. Infected animals gradually become skinnier, emaciated or “wasted” despite continuing to eat. They may show abnormal behaviors such as a wide stance, staggering gait, or inability to keep their head up.\n\nWhat should I do if I see a sick deer or elk and am concerned it might be chronic wasting disease?", "title": "\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "dd2c94212064f84d-15956-17937", "source": "", "score": 14.904566, "text": "\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n\nBoth the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend not consuming any tissues from CWD-infected animals.\nImproper disposal of meat or other parts  from CWD-positive animals is believed to be the greatest risk for introducing CWD into different/ undetected areas of California’s deer and elk herds. Please do no bury, throw in the trash, leave out for scavengers, feed to your dog, or take to a landfill potentially contaminated meat or other tissues.\nPrions can survive in the environment for 10+ years, and can be absorbed by roots and distributed in growing forage. \nIncineration is the safest disposal method for contaminated meat or tissues.\nPlease call your local CDFW office or the Wildlife Health Laboratory at (916) 358-2790, and we will arrange for the meat or tissues to be picked up and/or destroyed at no cost to you.

While it is possible to test for and detect CWD prions in meat and other tissues, these tests are currently only available in specialized research labs and not for diagnostic or consumer use. \nThere is no “meat safety” test for CWD. For current testing options, results are reported as “Detected” or “Not Detected” for CWD and other prion diseases. That means we can be certain an animal is positive for CWD if the prions are “detected” but we cannot be certain the animal did not have CWD if the results are “not detected.” This is one of the major issues surrounding CWD and other prion diseases and is in large part because of the attributes of the pathogen itself (the prion) and the sensitivities of the currently available tests \nFurthermore, if you brought back only the parts allowed by  CCR Title 14, Section 712 regulations, then the samples needed to perform an official CWD test are not available. These are the retropharyngeal lymph nodes or brainstem.\nBest practice is to have your animal tested for CWD in the state you are hunting, especially if that state or region has CWD. As such we recommend doing some research before hunting out-of-state to determine 1) CWD status of the state you are hunting in and 2) how to get an animal tested for CWD in the state it was harvested.\nSome labs such as Colorado State University Diagnostic Veterinary Laboratory or the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory allow hunting public to submit samples themselves for testing for a fee.\n\nHow do I declare my game at the border checkpoint, and what can I expect?", "title": "\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n"}, {"document_id": "dd2c94212064f84d-6066-8193", "source": "", "score": 10.741248, "text": "\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n\nThese include severely limiting the importation of captive deer and elk (and other cervids) into California (CCR Title 14, Section 671)), limiting what hunters can bring in from out-of-state hunts (no skull, no backbone) (CCR Title 14, Section 712)), and banning the feeding of wildlife to prevent artificially congregating susceptible animals (CCR Title 14, Section 251.3).\nSurveillance: Since 1999, California has tested over 6,500 deer and elk for CWD, the majority from hunter-harvested animals. In 2017, CDFW developed and implemented a statewide CWD surveillance plan, renewing our active CWD surveillance program and increasing yearly CWD testing goals. \nManagement: CDFW initiated an interagency CWD Task Force to develop and implement a CWD management plan. The surveillance portion of that has been implemented and the task force is working to finalize the management plan.\n\nCan chronic wasting disease be spread to humans?\n\nThere are no documented cases of CWD affecting a human. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that hunters do not eat meat from deer that test positive for CWD or otherwise appear sick. In addition, CDFW recommends that hunters wear latex or nitrile gloves when field-dressing and processing animals, and that hunters wash their hands and disinfect tools after processing.\n\nHow is chronic wasting disease diagnosed?\n\nCurrently, the only approved tests for CWD require lymph node or brainstem samples, taken after death, to detect the prion associated with CWD. However, this is an area of considerable research and we hope additional rapid and live-animal tests become available in the future. \n\nHunting in California FAQ\n\nI want to test the deer I harvested in California, where can I go to have that done?\n\nCheck the “Get Your Deer Tested” tab before you go hunting to look for a voluntary CWD sampling station near you.

While it is possible to test for and detect CWD prions in meat and other tissues, these tests are currently only available in specialized research labs and not for diagnostic or consumer use. \nThere is no “meat safety” test for CWD. For current testing options, results are reported as “Detected” or “Not Detected” for CWD and other prion diseases. That means we can be certain an animal is positive for CWD if the prions are “detected” but we cannot be certain the animal did not have CWD if the results are “not detected.” This is one of the major issues surrounding CWD and other prion diseases and is in large part because of the attributes of the pathogen itself (the prion) and the sensitivities of the currently available tests \nFurthermore, if you brought back only the parts allowed by  CCR Title 14, Section 712 regulations, then the samples needed to perform an official CWD test are not available. These are the retropharyngeal lymph nodes or brainstem.\nBest practice is to have your animal tested for CWD in the state you are hunting, especially if that state or region has CWD. As such we recommend doing some research before hunting out-of-state to determine 1) CWD status of the state you are hunting in and 2) how to get an animal tested for CWD in the state it was harvested.\nSome labs such as Colorado State University Diagnostic Veterinary Laboratory or the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory allow hunting public to submit samples themselves for testing for a fee.\n\nHow do I declare my game at the border checkpoint, and what can I expect?", "title": "\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n", "reference": true}, {"document_id": "46a9328592b4ab45-414621-416158", "source": "", "score": 6.1714044, "text": "\r\n\tCalifornia Fish and Wildlife Journal - Contents\r\n\nViolations of Fish and Game Laws\nFishery Products, April, May, and June, 1932\n\nCalifornia Fish and Game 18(3).
