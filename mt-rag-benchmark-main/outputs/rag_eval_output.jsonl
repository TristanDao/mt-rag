The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created. This type of database can be less complex to work with since no partitioning scheme needs to be defined, but you can create only global secondary indexes.\n\nIBM Cloudant strongly encourages you to use a partitioned database for best long-term database performance where the data model allows for logical partitioning of documents.\n\nThe partitioning type of a database is set at database creation time. When you create a database, use the partitioned query string parameter to set whether the database is partitioned.

The natural network and system characteristics of the network might mean that changes made to a document stored in one location can't instantly update or replicate to other parts of the database.\n\nIn other words, independent updates can be made to different copies of documents. The effect of these updates might be to introduce disagreement or \"conflicts\" as to what is the correct, definitive content for the document.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae tries to help you avoid conflicts by warning you of potential problems. It warns you by returning a [409 response](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/apidocs\/cloudantlist-of-http-codes) to a problematic update request. However, a 409 response might not be received if the database update is requested on a system that isn't currently connected to the network. For example, the database might be on a mobile device that is temporarily disconnected from the Internet, which makes it impossible to check whether other potentially conflicting updates were made.\n\nIf you request a document that is in a conflict situation, IBM Cloudant returns the document as expected. However, an internal algorithm considers a number of factors before it determines which document version to return.

As the number of databases grows, the replication latency is likely to increase if you try to replicate everything contained in an account.","reference":true},{"document_id":"ibmcld_00576-7385-9302","source":"Cloudant","score":17.440033,"text":"\nIBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether. Otherwise, separate databases, for example, users, orders, products, might be better so that secondary indexes are specific to each object type.\n\nIf you're storing arrays of objects within a document, consider whether the array items must really be their own document. For example, a product and each product review must be stored in separate documents, but a user and each of that user's orders must have their own document.\n\nIf you have an ever-growing data set, then you probably don't want to store data in a single, ever-growing database. Data is best stored in time-boxed databases that allow older data to be archived and deleted cleanly.

Bad data models are often hard to change after you\u2019re in production.\n\nThe previous pattern can be solved efficiently by using partitioned databases, which are covered in greater detailed later.\n\nFor more information, see the following documentation:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant guide to [data modeling](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-five-tips-for-modeling-your-data-to-scale-faq)\n* [Database partitions](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Keep documents small \n\nIBM Cloudant imposes a max doc size of 1 MB.

JSON decoding is costly, for example.\n\nLet's look at the following sections: Documents must group data that mostly changes together and Keep documents small.

The data type is detected automatically and assigned to the field during document ingestion. The assignment is based on the data type that is detected from the first document that is indexed. Ingestion errors can occur in subsequent documents if a different data type is detected for the value in the same field. Therefore, if your documents have a mix of data types in a single field, first ingest the document that has a value with the most flexible data type, such as String, in the field.\n\nWhen you crawl a website or upload an HTML file, the HTML content is added to the collection and indexed in an html field.\n\nThe following table shows the maximum size limit for fields per document.\n\n\n\nMaximum field sizes\n\n Field type Maximum allowed size per document \n\n html field 5 MB \n Sum of all other fields 1 MB \n\n\n\nIf the maximum size of the fields in the document exceeds the allowed limits, they are treated as follows:\n\n\n\n* For a document with an oversized html field, all of the fields in the document are indexed except the html field.\n\nFor IBM Cloud Pak for Data version 4.0 and earlier, the entire document is not indexed.\n* For a document with oversized non-HTML fields, the document is not indexed.\n\n\n\nIf you are uploading a Microsoft Excel file and a message is displayed that indicates that the non-HTML field size limit is exceeded, consider converting the XLS file into a CSV file.

Create some sample data that represents a book in a library as shown in the following example:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"BXP9G5ZQY9Q4EA13\",\n\"author\": \"Dickens\",\n\"title\": \"David Copperfield\",\n\"year\": 1840,\n\"pages\": 723,\n\"publisher\": \"Penguin\",\n\"url\": \"https:\/\/www.somurl.com\/dc\"\n}\n3. Continue to add some documents that match the pattern in the previous step by using the IBM Cloudant Dashboard.\n\nThe documents store simple key\/value pairs that hold metadata about each book: its author and its publisher. In this example, we address the following three use-cases:\n\n\n\n1. A query facility that allows a user to find a book by a known publisher and year.\n2. A general-purpose search engine that allows a user to find books by a combination of one or more of the following descriptors: author, title, year, and publisher.\n3. A report that details the number of books that are published by year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2.

You can use a service's Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges. A Lite plan might be offered on a monthly cycle that is renewed each month or on a one-off usage basis. Lite pricing plans are available with all account types. You can have one instance of a Lite plan for each service.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https:\/\/cloud.ibm.com\/docs\/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable)."},{"document_id":"ibmcld_03166-4-2012","source":"assistant","score":40.71434,"text":"\nThis documentation is for the classic Watson Assistant experience.

This value is a case-sensitive string.\n* sub: Represents the principal that is the subject of the JWT. This value must either be scoped to be locally unique in the context of the issuer or be globally unique. The value you specify for sub is used as the user_id.\n\nThe user ID that is specified in the sub claim is also sent in the customer_id section of the X-Watson-Metadata HTTP header.

This includes checking the CPU and memory level of your nodes. If any node is over 80% in either CPU or memory usage, consider provisioning more nodes or reducing your workload.Secondly if all worker nodes in a cluster, or in a single zone, subnet, or VLAN are affected, you can open an initial support ticket without gathering data. However, you might later be asked to gather the relevant data. If only one or some of your worker nodes are affected, you must gather the relevant data to include in your support ticket.  Before opening a support ticket, it is recommended to review the information and follow any troubleshooting steps in Debugging worker nodes, Worker node states, and Troubleshooting worker nodes in Critical or NotReady state. To gather worker node data, you can use the command 'kubectl top node' (for Kubernetes clusters) or 'oc top node' (for OpenShift clusters), which will display the CPU and memory usage of each node and once you have gathered this information, include it in your support ticket when you open one.
